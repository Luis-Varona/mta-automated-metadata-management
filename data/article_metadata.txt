Title: Functorial and algebraic properties of Browns P functor
Authors: Luis-Javier Hernandez-Paricio
Abstract: In 1975 E. M. Brown constructed a functor $\cal P$ which carries the tower of fundamental groups of the end of a (nice) space to the Brown-Grossman fundamental group. In this work, we study this functor and its extensions and analogues defined for pro-sets, pro-pointed sets, pro-groups and pro-abelian groups. The new versions of the $\cal P$ functor are provided with more algebraic structure. Examples given in the paper prove that in general the $\cal P$ functors are not faithful, however, one of our main results establishes that the restrictions of the corresponding $\cal P$ functors to the full subcategories of towers are faithful. We also prove that the restrictions of the $\cal P$ functors to the corresponding full subcategories of finitely generated towers are also full. Consequently, in these cases, the towers of objects in the categories of sets, pointed sets, groups and abelian groups, can be replaced by adequate algebraic models ($M$-sets, $M$-pointed sets, near-modules and modules.) The article also contains the construction of left adjoints for the $\cal P$ functors.

Title: On finite induced crossed modules and the homotopy 2-type of mapping cones
Authors: Ronald Brown, Christopher D. Wensley
Abstract: Results on the finiteness of induced crossed modules are proved both algebraically and topologically. Using the Van Kampen type theorem for the fundamental crossed module, applications are given to the 2-types of mapping cones of classifying spaces of groups. Calculations of the cohomology classes of some finite crossed modules are given, using crossed complex methods.

Abstract: Strong promonoidal functors are defined. Left Kan extension (also called "existential quantification") along a strong promonoidal functor is shown to be a strong monoidal functor. A construction for the free monoidal category on a promonoidal category is provided. A Fourier-like transform of presheaves is defined and shown to take convolution product to cartesian product.

Abstract: For an adjoint string V -| W -| X -| Y : B --> C, with Y fully faithful, it is frequently, but not always, the case that the composite VY underlies an idempotent monad. When it does, we call the string distributive. We also study shorter and longer `distributive' adjoint strings and how to generate them. These provide a new construction of the simplicial 2-category, Delta.

Title: A forbidden-suborder characterization of binarily-composable diagrams in double categories
Authors: Robert Dawson
Abstract: Tilings of rectangles with rectangles, and tileorders (the associated double order structures) are useful as ``templates'' for composition in double categories. In this context, it is particularly relevant to ask which tilings may be joined together, two rectangles at a time, to form one large rectangle. We characterize such tilings via forbidden suborders, in a manner analogous to Kuratowski's characterization of planar graphs.

Abstract: We introduce MD-sketches, which are a particular kind of Finite Sum sketches. Two interesting results about MD-sketches are proved. First, we show that, given two MD-sketches, it is algorithmically decidable whether their model categories are equivalent. Next we show that data-specifications, as used in database-design and software engineering, can be translated to MD-sketches. As a corollary, we obtain that equivalence of data-specifications is decidable.

Abstract: Locally finitely presentable categories are known to be precisely the categories of models of essentially algebraic theories, i.e., categories of partial algebras whose domains of definition are determined by equations in total operations. Here we show an analogous description of locally finitely multipresentable categories. We also prove that locally finitely multipresentable categories are precisely categories of models of sketches with finite limit and countable coproduct specifications, and we present an example of a locally finitely multipresentable category not sketchable by a sketch with finite limit and finite colimit specifications.

Title: Combinatorics of curvature, and the Bianchi identity
Authors: Anders Kock
Abstract: We analyze the Bianchi Identity as an instance of a basic fact of combinatorial groupoid theory, related to the Homotopy Addition Lemma. Here it becomes formulated in terms of 2-forms with values in the gauge group bundle of a groupoid, and leads in particular to the (Chern-Weil) construction of characteristic classes. The method is that of synthetic differential geometry, using "the first neighbourhood of the diagonal" of a manifold as its basic combinatorial structure. We introduce as a tool a new and simple description of wedge (= exterior) products of differential forms in this context.

Title: Remarks on Quintessential and Persistent Localizations
Authors: P. T. Johnstone
Abstract: We define a localization L of a category E to be quintessential if the left adjoint to the inclusion functor is also right adjoint to it, and persistent if L is closed under subobjects in E. We show that quintessential localizations of an arbitrary Cauchy-complete category correspond to idempotent natural endomorphisms of its identity functor, and that they are necessarily persistent. Our investigation of persistent localizations is largely restricted to the case when E is a topos: we show that persistence is equivalence to the closure of L under finite coproducts and quotients, and that it implies that L is coreflective as well as reflective, at least provided E admits a geometric morphism to a Boolean topos. However, we provide examples to show that the reflector and coreflector need not coincide.

Authors: Michael Barr
Abstract: In a 1981 book, H. Putnam claimed that in a pure relational language without equality, for any model of a relation that was neither empty nor full, there was another model that satisfies the same first order sentences. Ed Keenan observed that this was false for finite models since equality is a definable predicate in such cases. This note shows that Putnam's claim is true for infinite models, although it requires a more sophisticated proof than the one outlined by Putnam.

Title: Lax Operad Actions and Coherence for Monoidal n-Categories, A_{\infty}, Rings and Modules
Authors: Gerald Dunn
Abstract: We establish a general coherence theorem for lax operad actions on an n-category which implies that an n-category with such an action is lax equivalent to one with a strict action. This includes familiar coherence results (e.g. for symmetric monoidal categories) and many new ones. In particular, any braided monoidal n-category is lax equivalent to a strict braided monoidal n-category. We also obtain coherence theorems for A_{\infty} and E_{\infty} rings and for lax modules over such rings. Using these results we give an extension of Morita equivalence to A_{\infty} rings and some applications to infinite loop spaces and algebraic K-theory.

Title: Proof theory for full intuitionistic linear logic, bilinear logic, and MIX categories
Authors: J. R. B. Cockett, R. A. G. Seely
Abstract: This note applies techniques we have developed to study coherence in monoidal categories with two tensors, corresponding to the tensor-par fragment of linear logic, to several new situations, including Hyland and de Paiva's Full Intuitionistic Linear Logic (FILL), and Lambek's Bilinear Logic (BILL). Note that the latter is a noncommutative logic; we also consider the noncommutative version of FILL. The essential difference between FILL and BILL lies in requiring that a certain tensorial strength be an isomorphism. In any FILL category, it is possible to isolate a full subcategory of objects (the ``nucleus'') for which this transformation is an isomorphism. In addition, we define and study the appropriate categorical structure underlying the MIX rule. For all these structures, we do not restrict consideration to the ``pure'' logic as we allow non-logical axioms. We define the appropriate notion of proof nets for these logics, and use them to describe coherence results for the corresponding categorical structures.

Title: The reflectiveness of covering morphisms in algebra and geometry
Authors: G. Janelidze, G. M. Kelly
Abstract: Each full reflective subcategory X of a finitely-complete category C gives rise to a factorization system (E, M) on C, where E consists of the morphisms of C inverted by the reflexion I : C --> X. Under a simplifying assumption which is satisfied in many practical examples, a morphism f : A --> B lies in M precisely when it is the pullback along the unit \etaB : B --> IB of its reflexion If : IA --> IB; whereupon f is said to be a trivial covering of B. Finally, the morphism f : A --> B is said to be a covering of B if, for some effective descent morphism p : E --> B, the pullback p^*f of f along p is a trivial covering of E. This is the absolute notion of covering; there is also a more general relative one, where some class \Theta of morphisms of C is given, and the class Cov(B) of coverings of B is a subclass -- or rather a subcategory -- of the category C \downarrow B \subset C/B whose objects are those f : A --> B with f in \Theta. Many questions in mathematics can be reduced to asking whether Cov(B) is reflective in C \downarrow B; and we give a number of disparate conditions, each sufficient for this to be so. In this way we recapture old results and establish new ones on the reflexion of local homeomorphisms into coverings, on the Galois theory of commutative rings, and on generalized central extensions of universal algebras.

Title: Monads and interpolads in bicategories
Authors: Jurgen Koslowski
Abstract: Given a bicategory, 2, with stable local coequalizers, we construct a bicategory of monads Y-mnd by using lax functors from the generic 0-cell, 1-cell and 2-cell, respectively, into Y. Any lax functor into Y factors through Y-mnd and the 1-cells turn out to be the familiar bimodules. The locally ordered bicategory rel and its bicategory of monads both fail to be Cauchy-complete, but have a well-known Cauchy-completion in common. This prompts us to formulate a concept of Cauchy-completeness for bicategories that are not locally ordered and suggests a weakening of the notion of monad. For this purpose, we develop a calculus of general modules between unstructured endo-1-cells. These behave well with respect to composition, but in general fail to have identities. To overcome this problem, we do not need to impose the full structure of a monad on endo-1-cells. We show that associative coequalizing multiplications suffice and call the resulting structures interpolads. Together with structure-preserving i-modules these form a bicategory Y-int that is indeed Cauchy-complete, in our sense, and contains the bicategory of monads as a not necessarily full sub-bicategory. Interpolads over rel are idempotent relations, over the suspension of set they correspond to interpolative semi-groups, and over spn they lead to a notion of ``category without identities'' also known as ``taxonomy''. If Y locally has equalizers, then modules in general, and the bicategories Y-mnd and Y-int in particular, inherit the property of being closed with respect to 1-cell composition.

Title: On property-like structures
Authors: G. M. Kelly, Stephen Lack
Abstract: A category may bear many monoidal structures, but (to within a unique isomorphism) only one structure of `category with finite products'. To capture such distinctions, we consider on a 2-category those 2-monads for which algebra structure is essentially unique if it exists, giving a precise mathematical definition of `essentially unique' and investigating its consequences. We call such 2-monads <em> property-like</em>. We further consider the more restricted class of <em> fully property-like</em> 2-monads, consisting of those property-like 2-monads for which all 2-cells between (even lax) algebra morphisms are algebra 2-cells. The consideration of lax morphisms leads us to a new characterization of those monads, studied by Kock and Zoberlein, for which `structure is adjoint to unit', and which we now call <em> lax-idempotent</em> 2-monads: both these and their <em> colax-idempotent</em> duals are fully property-like. We end by showing that (at least for finitary 2-monads) the classes of property-likes, fully property-likes, and lax-idempotents are each coreflective among all 2-monads.

Title: Closed model categories for $[n,m]$-types
Authors: J. Ignacio Extremiana Aldana, Luis J. Hernandez Paricio, Maria T. Rivas Rodriguez
Abstract: For m >= n > 0, a map f between pointed spaces is said to be a weak [n,m]-equivalence if f induces isomorphisms of the homotopy groups \pi_k for n <= k <= m~. Associated with this notion we give two different closed model category structures to the category of pointed spaces. Both structures have the same class of weak equivalences but different classes of fibrations and therefore of cofibrations. Using one of these structures, one obtains that the localized category is equivalent to the category of n-reduced CW-complexes with dimension less than or equal to m+1 and m-homotopy classes of cellular pointed maps. Using the other structure we see that the localized category is also equivalent to the homotopy category of (n-1)-connected (m+1)-coconnected CW-complexes.

Authors: David B. Benson
Abstract: We give a precise characterization for when the models of the tensor product of sketches are structurally isomorphic to the models of either sketch in the models of the other. For each base category K call the just mentioned property (sketch) K-multilinearity. Say that two sketches are K-compatible with respect to base category K just in case in each K-model, the limits for each limit specification in each sketch commute with the colimits for each colimit specification in the other sketch and all limits and colimits are pointwise. Two sketches are K-multilinear if and only if the two sketches are K-compatible. This property then extends to strong Colimits of sketches.

Abstract: In the literature there are several kinds of concrete and abstract cell complexes representing composition in n-categories, \omega-categories or \infty-categories, and the slightly more general partial \omega-categories. Some examples are parity c omplexes, pasting schemes and directed complexes. In this paper we give an axiomatic treatment: that is to say, we study the class of `\omega-complexes' which consists of all complexes representing partial \omega-categories. We show that \omega-complexes can be given geometric structures and that in most important examples they become well-behaved CW complexes; we characterise \omega-complexes by conditions on their cells; we show that a product of \omega-complexes is again an \omega-complex; and we describe some products in detail.

Consequently, an equivariant simplicial version of the Whitehead Theorem is derived.

Title: A 2-Categorical Approach To Change Of Base And Geometric Morphisms II
Authors: A. Carboni, G. M. Kelly, D. Verity, R. J. Wood
Abstract: We introduce a notion of <em> equipment </em> which generalizes the earlier notion of <em> pro-arrow equipment </em> and includes such familiar constructs as $\rel\K$, $\spn\K$, $\par\K$, and $\pro\K$ for a suitable category $\K$, along with related constructs such as the $\V$-$\pro$ arising from a suitable monoidal category $\V$. We further exhibit the equipments as the objects of a 2-category, in such a way that <em> arbitrary </em> functors $F:\eL ---> \K$ induce equipment arrows $\rel F:\rel\eL --->\rel\K$, $\spn F:\spn\eL ---> \spn\K$, and so on, and similarly for arbitrary monoidal functors $\V ---> \W$. The article I with the title above dealt with those equipments $\M$ having each $\M(A,B)$ only an ordered set, and contained a detailed analysis of the case $\M =\rel\K$; in the present article we allow the $\M(A,B)$ to be general categories, and illustrate our results by a detailed study of the case $\M=\spn\K$. We show in particular that $\spn$ is a locally-fully-faithful 2-functor to the 2-category of equipments, and determine its image on arrows. After analyzing the nature of adjunctions in the 2-category of equipments, we are able to give a simple characterization of those $\spn G$ which arise from a <em> geometric morphism</em> $G$.

Title: Applications of Peiffer pairings in the Moore complex of a simplicial group
Authors: A. Mutlu, T. Porter
Abstract: Generalising a result of Brown and Loday, we give for n=3 and 4, a decomposition of the group, d_nNG_n, of boundaries of a simplicial group G as a product of commutator subgroups. Partial results are given for higher dimensions. Applications to 2-crossed modules and quadratic modules are discussed. <p> Please note the electronically available References at <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/1998/n7/reference.html"> http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/1998/n7/reference.html </a>

Title: On Generic Separable Objects
Authors: Robbie Gates
Abstract: The notion of {\em separable} (alternatively {\em unramified}, or {\em decidable}) objects and their place in a categorical theory of space have been described by Lawvere (see \cite{lawvere:como}), drawing on notions of separable from algebra and unramified from geometry. In \cite{schanuel:halifax}, Schanuel constructed the generic separable object in an extensive category with products as an object of the free category with finite sums on the dual of the category of finite sets and injections.

Title: A note on discrete Conduche fibrations
Authors: Peter Johnstone
Abstract: The class of functors known as discrete Conduch&eacute; fibrations forms a common generalization of discrete fibrations and discrete opfibrations, and shares many of the formal properties of these two classes. F. Lamarche conjectured that, for any small category $\cal B$, the category ${\bf DCF}/{\cal B}$ of discrete Conduch&eacute; fibrations over $\cal B$ should be a topos. In this note we show that, although for suitable categories $\cal B$ the discrete Conduch&eacute fibrations over $\cal B$ may be presented as the `sheaves' for a family of coverings on a category ${\cal B}_{tw}$ constructed from $\cal B$, they are in general very far from forming a topos.

Title: A tensor product for Gray-categories
Authors: Sjoerd Crans
Abstract: In this paper I extend Gray's tensor product of 2-categories to a new tensor product of Gray-categories. I give a description in terms of generators and relations, one of the relations being an ``interchange'' relation, and a description similar to Gray's description of his tensor product of 2-categories. I show that this tensor product of Gray-categories satisfies a universal property with respect to quasi-functors of two variables, which are defined in terms of lax-natural transformations between Gray-categories. The main result is that this tensor product is part of a monoidal structure on <b>Gray-Cat</b>, the proof requiring interchange in an essential way. However, this does not give a monoidal {(bi)closed} structure, precisely because of interchange. And although I define composition of lax-natural transformations, this composite need not be a lax-natural transformation again, making <b>Gray-Cat</b> only a partial <b>Gray-Cat</b>$_\otimes$-CATegory.

Authors: Stephen Lack
Abstract: A new description of the exact completion $\cal C_{ex/reg}$ of a regular category $\cal C$ is given, using a certain topos $Shv(\cal C)$ of sheaves on $\cal C$; the exact completion is then constructed as the closure of $\cal C$ in $Shv(\cal C)$ under finite limits and coequalizers of equivalence relations. An infinitary generalization is proved, and the classical description of the exact completion is derived.

Title: Distributive laws for pseudomonads
Authors: Francisco Marmolejo
Abstract: We define distributive laws between pseudomonads in a Gray-category A, as the classical two triangles and the two pentagons but commuting only up to isomorphism. These isomorphisms must satisfy nine coherence conditions. We also define the \gray-category PSM(A) of pseudomonads in A, and define a lifting to be a pseudomonad in PSM(A). We define what is a pseudomonad with compatible structure with respect to two given pseudomonads. We show how to obtain a pseudomonad with compatible structure from a distributive law, how to get a lifting from a pseudomonad with compatible structure, and how to obtain a distributive law from a lifting. We show that one triangle suffices to define a distributive law in case that one of the pseudomonads is a (co-)KZ-doctrine and the other a KZ-doctrine.

Title: When projective does not imply flat, and other homological anomalies
Authors: L. Gaunce Lewis, Jr.
Abstract: If $\cal M$ is both an abelian category and a symmetric monoidal closed category, then it is natural to ask whether projective objects in $\cal M$ are flat, and whether the tensor product of two projective objects is projective. In the most familiar such categories, the answer to these questions is obviously yes. However, the category $\cal M_G$ of Mackey functors for a compact Lie group $G$ is a category of this type in which projective objects need not be so well-behaved. This category is of interest since good equivariant cohomology theories are Mackey functor valued. The tensor product on $\cal M_G$ is important in this context because of the role it plays in the not yet fully understood universal coefficient and K\"{u}nneth formulae. This role makes the relationship between projective objects and the tensor product especially critical. Unfortunately, if $G$ is, for example, $O(n)$, then projectives need not be flat in $\cal M_G$ and the tensor product of projective objects need not be projective. This misbe haviorcomplicates the search for full strength equivariant universal coefficient and K\"{u}nneth formulae.

Title: A Note on Rewriting Theory for Uniqueness of Iteration
Authors: M. Okada, P. J. Scott
Abstract: Uniqueness for higher type term constructors in lambda calculi (e.g. surjective pairing for product types, or uniqueness of iterators on the natural numbers) is easily expressed using universally quantified conditional equations. We use a technique of Lambek [18] involving Mal'cev operators to equationally express uniqueness of iteration (more generally, higher-order primitive recursion) in a simply typed lambda calculus, essentially Godel's T [29,13]. We prove the following facts about typed lambda calculus with uniqueness for primitive recursors: (i) It is undecidable, (ii) Church-Rosser fails, although ground Church-Rosser holds, (iii) strong normalization (termination) is still valid. This entails the undecidability of the coherence problem for cartesian closed categories with strong natural numbers objects, as well as providing a natural example of the following computational paradigm: a non-CR, ground CR, undecidable, terminating rewriting system.

Abstract: We define the notion of enriched Lawvere theory, for enrichment over a monoidal biclosed category $V$ that is locally finitely presentable as a closed category. We prove that the category of enriched Lawvere theories is equivalent to the category of finitary monads on $V$. Moreover, the $V$-category of models of a Lawvere $V$-theory is equivalent to the $V$-category of algebras for the corresponding $V$-monad. This all extends routinely to local presentability with respect to any regular cardinal. We finally consider the special case where $V$ is $Cat$, and explain how the correspondence extends to pseudo maps of algebras.

Title: Natural deduction and coherence for non-symmetric linearly distributive categories
Authors: Robert R. Schneck
Abstract: In this paper certain proof-theoretic techniques of [BCST] are applied to <i>non-symmetric</i> linearly distributive categories, corresponding to <i>non-commutative</i> negation-free multiplicative linear logic (mLL). First, the correctness criterion for the two-sided proof nets developed in [BCST] is adjusted to work in the non-commutative setting. Second, these proof nets are used to represent morphisms in a (non-symmetric) linearly distributive category; a notion of proof-net equivalence is developed which permits a considerable sharpening of the previous coherence results concerning these categories, including a decision procedure for the equality of maps when there is a certain restriction on the units. In particular a decision procedure is obtained for the equivalence of proofs in non-commutative negation-free mLL without non-logical axioms.

We also have some new results concerning the general theory of KZ-doctrines, such as the closure under composition of discrete fibrations for a KZ-doctrine, in the sense of Bunge and Funk.

Abstract: It is well-known that, given a Dedekind category {\cal R} the category of (typed) matrices with coefficients from {\cal R} is a Dedekind category with arbitrary relational sums. In this paper we show that under slightly stronger assumptions the converse is also true. Every atomic Dedekind category {\cal R} with relational sums and subobjects is equivalent to a category of matrices over a suitable basis. This basis is the full proper subcategory induced by the integral objects of {\cal R}. Furthermore, we use our concept of a basis to extend a known result from the theory of heterogeneous relation algebras.

Both these factorizations give rise to a factorization system, in a suitable 2-categorical sense, in the 2-category of symmetric cat-groups. An application to exact sequences is given.

Title: Balanced Coalgebroids
Authors: Paddy McCrudden
Abstract: A balanced coalgebroid is a ${\cal V}^{op}$-category with extra structure ensuring that its category of representations is a balanced monoidal category. We show, in a sense to be made precise, that a balanced structure on a coalgebroid may be reconstructed from the corresponding structure on its category of representations. This includes the reconstruction of dual quasi-bialgebras, quasi-triangular dual quasi-bialgebras, and balanced quasi-triangular dual quasi-bialgebras; the latter of which is a quantum group when equipped with a compatible antipode. As an application we construct a balanced coalgebroid whose category of representations is equivalent to the symmetric monoidal category of chain complexes. The appendix provides the definitions of a braided monoidal bicategory and sylleptic monoidal bicategory.

Title: On the monadicity of categories with chosen colimits
Authors: G. M. Kelly, Stephen Lack
Abstract: There is a 2-category {\cal J}{\bf-Colim} of small categories equipped with a choice of colimit for each diagram whose domain $J$ lies in a given small class {\cal J} of small categories, functors strictly preserving such colimits, and natural transformations. The evident forgetful 2-functor from {\cal J}{\bf-Colim} to the 2-category {\bf Cat} of small categories is known to be monadic. We extend this result by considering not just conical colimits, but general weighted colimits; not just ordinary categories but enriched ones; and not just small classes of colimits but large ones; in this last case we are forced to move from the 2-category {\cal V}{\bf-Cat} of small {\cal V}-categories to {\cal V}-categories with object-set in some larger universe. In each case, the functors preserving the colimits in the usual ``up-to-isomorphism'' sense are recovered as the {\em pseudomorphisms} between algebras for the 2-monad in question.

Abstract: For a set ${\cal M}$ of graphs the category ${\bf Cat}_{\cal M}$ of all ${\cal M}$-complete categories and all strictly ${\cal M}$-continuous functors is known to be monadic over ${\bf Cat}$. The question of monadicity of ${\bf Cat}_{\cal M}$ over the category of graphs is known to have an affirmative answer when ${\cal M}$ specifies either (i) all finite limits, or (ii) all finite products, or (iii) equalizers and terminal objects, or (iv) just terminal objects. We prove that, conversely, these four cases are (essentially) the only cases of monadicity of $\Cat_\M$ over the category of graphs, provided that ${\cal M}$ is a set of finite graphs containing the empty graph.

Abstract: The notion of normal subobject having an intrinsic meaning in any protomodular category, we introduce the notion of normal functor, namely left exact conservative functor which reflects normal subobjects. The point is that for the category {\bf Gp} of groups the change of base functors, with respect to the fibration of pointed objects, are not only conservative (this is the definition of a protomodular category), but also normal. This leads to the notion of strongly protomodular category. Some of their properties are given, the main one being that this notion is inherited by the slice categories.

In particular, let ${\cal O}(G,X)$ be the category of canonical orbits of a discrete group $G$, over a $G$-set $X$. We show that projectivity of $R{\cal O}(G,X)$-modules is preserved by this tensor product. Moreover, if $G$ is a finite group, $X$ a finite $G$-set and $R$ is an integral domain then such a tensor product of two injective $R{\cal O}(G,X)$-modules is again injective.

Although we eventually work in the smooth topos, the first two sections do not mention topos theory and should be of interest to non-topos theorists.

Title: $n$-Permutable locally finitely presentable categories
Authors: Marino Gran, Maria Cristina Pedicchio
Abstract: We characterize $n$-permutable locally finitely presentable categories $Lex[{\mathcal C}^{op}, Set]$ by a condition on the dual of the essentially algebraic theory $\mathcal C^{op}$. We apply these results to exact Maltsev categories as well as to $n$-permutable quasivarieties and varieties.

Title: Exponentiable Morphisms: Posets, Spaces, Locales, and Grothendieck Toposes
Authors: Susan Niefield
Abstract: which the induced geometric morphism of presheaf toposes is exponentiable in the category of Grothendieck toposes. In particular, we show that a necessary condition is that the induced map $p^{\downarrow} : P^{\downarrow}\to B^{\downarrow}$ is exponentiable in the category of topological spaces, where $P^{\downarrow}$ is the space whose points are elements of $P$ and open sets are downward closed subsets of $P$. Along the way, we show that $p^{\downarrow} : P^{\downarrow}\to B^{\downarrow}$ is exponentiable if and only if $p : P\to B$ is exponentiable in the category of posets and satisfies an additional compactness condition. The criteria for exponentiability of morphisms of posets is related to (but weaker than) the factorization-lifting property for exponentiability of morphisms in the category of small categories (considered independently by Giraud and Conduch&eacute;).

Title: On sifted colimits and generalized varieties
Authors: J. Adamek, J. Rosicky
Abstract: Filtered colimits, i.e., colimits over schemes $\cal D$ such that $\cal D$-colimits in $\Set$ commute with finite limits, have a natural generalization to sifted colimits: these are colimits over schemes $\cal D$ such that $\cal D$-colimits in $\Set$ commute with finite products. An important example: reflexive coequalizers are sifted colimits. Generalized varieties are defined as free completions of small categories under sifted-colimits (analogously to finitely accessible categories which are free filtered-colimit completions of small categories). Among complete categories, generalized varieties are precisely the varieties. Further examples: category of fields, category of linearly ordered sets, category of nonempty sets.

Title: On Mackey topologies in topological abelian groups
Authors: Michael Barr, Heinrich Kleisli
Abstract: Let $\cal C$ be a full subcategory of the category of topological abelian groups and SP$\cal C$ denote the full subcategory of subobjects of products of objects of $\cal C$. We say that SP$\cal C$ has Mackey coreflections if there is a functor that assigns to each object $A$ of SP$\cal C$ an object $\tau A$ that has the same group of characters as $A$ and is the finest topology with that property. We show that the existence of Mackey coreflections in SP$\cal C$ is equivalent to the injectivity of the circle with respect to topological subgroups of groups in $\cal C$. <p> <p> Keywords: Mackey topologies, duality, topological abelian groups.

Abstract: In this paper we describe a deductive system for categories with finite products and coproducts, prove decidability of equality of morphisms <it> via</it> cut elimination, and prove a ``Whitman theorem'' for the free such categories over arbitrary base categories. This result provides a nice illustration of some basic techniques in categorical proof theory, and also seems to have slipped past unproved in previous work in this field. Furthermore, it suggests a type-theoretic approach to 2-player input-output games.

Title: On the pullback stability of a quotient map with respect to a closure operator
Authors: Lurdes Sousa
Abstract: There are well-known characterizations of the hereditary quotient maps in the category of topological spaces, (that is, of quotient maps stable under pullback along embeddings), as well as of universal quotient maps (that is, of quotient maps stable under pullback). These are precisely the so-called pseudo-open maps, as shown by Arhangel'skii, and the bi-quotient maps of Michael, as shown by Day and Kelly, respectively. In this paper hereditary and stable quotient maps are characterized in the broader context given by a category equipped with a closure operator. To this end, we derive explicit formulae and conditions for the closure in the codomain of such a quotient map in terms of the closure in its domain.

Title: Duality for Simple $\omega$-Categories and Disks
Authors: Mihaly Makkai, Marek Zawadowski
Abstract: A. Joyal has introduced the category $\cal D$ of the so-called <it>finite disks</it>, and used it to define the concept of $\theta$-category, a notion of weak $\omega$-category. We introduce the notion of an $\omega$-graph being <it> composable </it> (meaning roughly that 'it has a unique composite'), and call an $\omega$-category <it>simple</it> if it is freely generated by a composable $\omega$-graph. The category $\cal S$ of simple $\omega$-categories is a full subcategory of the category, with strict $\omega$-functors as morphisms, of all $\omega$-categories. The category $\cal S$ is a key ingredient in another concept of weak $\omega$-category, called protocategory. We prove that $\cal D$ and $\cal S$ are contravariantly equivalent, by a duality induced by a suitable schizophrenic object living in both categories. In [MZ], this result is one of the tools used to show that the concept of $\theta$-category and that of protocategory are equivalent in a suitable sense. We also prove that composable $\omega$-graphs coincide with the $\omega$-graphs of the form $T^*$ considered by M.Batanin, which were characterized by R. Street and called `globular cardinals'. Batanin's construction, using globular cardinals, of the free $\omega$-category on a globular set plays an important role in our paper. We give a self-contained presentation of Batanin's construction that suits our purposes.

Title: Finite sets and symmetric simplicial sets
Authors: Marco Grandis
Abstract: The category of finite cardinals (or, equivalently, of finite sets) is the symmetric analogue of the category of finite ordinals, and the ground category of a relevant category of presheaves, the <em> augmented symmetric simplicial sets.</em> We prove here that this ground category has characterisations similar to the classical ones for the category of finite ordinals, by the existence of a universal symmetric monoid, or by generators and relations. The latter provides a definition of symmetric simplicial sets by faces, degeneracies and transpositions, under suitable relations.

Title: How algebraic is algebra?
Authors: J. Adamek, F. W. Lawvere, J. Rosicky
Abstract: The 2-category VAR of finitary varieties is not varietal over CAT. We introduce the concept of an algebraically exact category and prove that the 2-category ALG of all algebraically exact categories is an equational hull of VAR w.r.t. all operations with rank. Every algebraically exact category $\cal K$ is complete, exact, and has filtered colimits which (a) commute with finite limits and (b) distribute over products; besides (c) regular epimorphisms in $\cal K$ are product-stable. It is not known whether (a) - (c) characterize algebraic exactness. An equational hull of VAR w.r.t. all operations is also discussed.

Title: Combinatorics of branchings in higher dimensional automata
Authors: Philippe Gaucher
Abstract: We explore the combinatorial properties of the branching areas of execution paths in higher dimensional automata. Mathematically, this means that we investigate the combinatorics of the negative corner (or branching) homology of a globular $\omega$-category and the combinatorics of a new homology theory called the reduced branching homology. The latter is the homology of the quotient of the branching complex by the sub-complex generated by its thin elements. Conjecturally it coincides with the non reduced theory for higher dimensional automata, that is $\omega$-categories freely generated by precubical sets. As application, we calculate the branching homology of some $\omega$-categories and we give some invariance results for the reduced branching homology. We only treat the branching side. The merging side, that is the case of merging areas of execution paths is similar and can be easily deduced from the branching side.

Title: How large are left exact functors?
Authors: J. Adamek, V. Koubek, V. Trnkova
Abstract: For a broad collection of categories $\cal K$, including all presheaf categories, the following statement is proved to be consistent: every left exact (i.e. finite-limits preserving) functor from $\cal K$ to $\Set$ is small, that is, a small colimit of representables. In contrast, for the (presheaf) category ${\cal K}=\Alg(1,1)$ of unary algebras we construct a functor from $\Alg(1,1)$ to $\Set$ which preserves finite products and is not small. We also describe all left exact set-valued functors as directed unions of ``reduced representables'', generalizing reduced products.

Title: Cartesian closed topological hull of the construct of closure spaces
Authors: V. Claes, E. Lowen-Colebunders, G. Sonck
Abstract: A cartesian closed topological hull of the construct CLS of closure spaces and continuous maps is constructed. The construction is performed in two steps. First a cartesian closed extension L of CLS is obtained. We apply a method worked out by J. Adamek and J. Reiterman for constructing extensions of constructs that in some sense ``resemble'' the construct of uniform spaces. Secondly, within this extension L the cartesian closed topological hull L* of CLS is characterized as a full subconstruct. In order to find the internal characterization of the objects of L* we produce a concrete functor to the category of power closed collections based on CLS as introduced by J. Adamek, J. Reiterman and G.E. Strecker.

Title: A sheaf-theoretic view of loop spaces
Authors: Mark W. Johnson
Abstract: provides a convenient viewpoint for models of the stable homotopy category as well as categories of finite loop spaces. Also, the languages of algebraic geometry and algebraic topology have been interacting quite heavily in recent years, primarily due to the work of Voevodsky and that of Hopkins. Thus, the language of Grothendieck topologies is becoming a necessary tool for the algebraic topologist. The current article is intended to give a somewhat relaxed introduction to this language of sheaves in a topological context, using familiar examples such as n-fold loop spaces and pointed G-spaces. This language also includes the diagram categories of spectra as well as spectra in the sense of Lewis, which will be discussed in some detail.

Title: On Functors Which Are Lax Epimorphisms
Authors: Jiri Adamek, Robert El Bashir, Manuela Sobral, Jiri Velebil
Abstract: We show that lax epimorphisms in the category Cat are precisely the functors $P : {\cal E} \to {\cal B}$ for which the functor $P^{*}: [{\cal B}, Set] \to [{\cal E}, Set]$ of composition with $P$ is fully faithful. We present two other characterizations. Firstly, lax epimorphisms are precisely the ``absolutely dense'' functors, i.e., functors $P$ such that every object $B$ of ${\cal B}$ is an absolute colimit of all arrows $P(E)\to B$ for $E$ in ${\cal E}$. Secondly, lax epimorphisms are precisely the functors $P$ such that for every morphism $f$ of ${\cal B}$ the category of all factorizations through objects of $P[{\cal E}]$ is connected.

Abstract: In analogy with the relation between closure operators in presheaf toposes and Grothendieck topologies, we identify the structure in a category with finite limits that corresponds to universal closure operators in its regular and exact completions. The study of separated objects in exact completions will then allow us to give conceptual proofs of local cartesian closure of different categories of pseudo equivalence relations. Finally, we characterize when certain categories of sheaves are toposes.

Title: A note on exactness and stability in homotopical algebra
Authors: Marco Grandis
Abstract: Exact sequences are a well known notion in homological algebra. We investigate here the more vague properties of `homotopical exactness', appearing for instance in the fibre or cofibre sequence of a map. Such notions of exactness can be given for very general `categories with homotopies' having <i> homotopy</i> kernels and cokernels, but become more interesting under suitable `stability' hypotheses, satisfied - in particular - by chain complexes. It is then possible to measure the default of homotopical exactness of a sequence by the homotopy type of a certain object, a sort of `homotopical homology'.

Title: A Note on Actions of a Monoidal Category
Authors: G. Janelidze, G. M. Kelly
Abstract: An action $* : \cal V \times \cal A \to \cal A$ of a monoidal category $\cal V$ on a category $\cal A$ corresponds to a strong monoidal functor $F : \cal V \to [\cal A,\cal A]$ into the monoidal category of endofunctors of $\cal A$. In many practical cases, the ordinary functor $f : \cal V \to [cal \A, \cal A]$ underlying the monoidal $F$ has a right adjoint $g$; and when this is so, $F$ itself has a right adjoint $G$ as a monoidal functor - so that, passing to the categories of monoids (also called ``algebras'') in $\cal V$ and in $[\cal A, \cal A]$, we have an adjunction $Mon F$ left adjoint to $Mon G$ between the category $Mon \cal V$ of monoids in $\cal V$ and the category $Mon [\cal A, \cal A] = Mnd \cal A$ of monads on $\cal A$. We give sufficient conditions for the existence of the right adjoint $g$, which involve the existence of right adjoints for the functors $X * - $ and $ * A$, and make $\cal A$ (at least when $\cal V$ is symmetric and closed) into a tensored and cotensored $cal \V$-category ${\bf A}$. We give explicit formulae, as large ends, for the right adjoints $g$ and $Mon G$, and also for some related right adjoints, when they exist; as well as another explicit expression for $Mon G$ as a large limit, which uses a new representation of any (large) limit of monads of two special kinds, and an analogous result for general endofunctors.

Title: Categorical domain theory: Scott topology, powercategories, coherent categories
Authors: Panagis Karazeris
Abstract: In the present article we continue recent work in the direction of domain theory were certain (accessible) categories are used as generalized domains. We discuss the possibility of using certain presheaf toposes as generalizations of the Scott topology at this level. We show that the toposes associated with Scott complete categories are injective with respect to dense inclusions of toposes. We propose analogues of the upper and lower powerdomain in terms of the Scott topology at the level of categories. We show that the class of finitely accessible categories is closed under this generalized upper powerdomain construction (the respective result about the lower powerdomain construction is essentially known). We also treat the notion of ``coherent domain'' by introducing two possible notions of coherence for a finitely accessible category (qua generalized domain). The one of them imitates the stability of the compact saturated sets under intersection and the other one imitates the so-called ``2/3 SFP'' property. We show that the two notions are equivalent. This amounts to characterizing the small categories whose free cocompletion under finite colimits has finite limits.

Title: The Hurwitz action and braid group orderings
Authors: Jonathon Funk
Abstract: In connection with the so-called Hurwitz action of homeomorphisms in ramified covers we define a groupoid, which we call a ramification groupoid of the 2-sphere, constructed as a certain path groupoid of the universal ramified cover of the 2-sphere with finitely many marked-points. Our approach to ramified covers is based on cosheaf spaces, which are closely related to Fox's complete spreads. A feature of a ramification groupoid is that it carries a certain order structure. The Artin group of braids of $n$ strands has an order-invariant action in the ramification groupoid of the sphere with $n+1$ marked-points. Left-invariant linear orderings of the braid group such as the Dehornoy ordering may be retrieved. Our work extends naturally to the braid group on countably many generators. In particular, we show that the underlying set of a free group on countably many generators (minus the identity element) can be linearly ordered in such a way that the classical Artin representation of a braid as an automorphism of the free group is an order-preserving action.

Title: Simplicial matrices and the nerves of weak n-categories I: nerves of bicategories
Authors: John W. Duskin
Abstract: To a bicategory <b>B</b> (in the sense of B&eacute;nabou) we assign a simplicial set <b>Ner(B)</b>, the <i>(geometric) nerve</i> of <b>B</b>, which completely encodes the structure of <b>B</b> as a bicategory. As a simplicial set <b>Ner(B)</b> is a subcomplex of its 2-Coskeleton and itself isomorphic to its 3-Coskeleton, what we call a 2-dimensional <i>Postnikov complex</i>. We then give, somewhat more delicately, a complete characterization of those simplicial sets which are the nerves of bicategories as certain 2-dimensional Postnikov complexes which satisfy certain restricted `exact horn-lifting' conditions whose satisfaction is controlled by (and here defines) subsets of (abstractly) <i>invertible</i> 2 and 1-simplices. Those complexes which have, at minimum, their degenerate 2-simplices always invertible and have an invertible 2-simplex $\chi_2^1(x_{12}, x_{01})$ present for each `composable pair' $(x_{12}, \_ , x_{01}) \in \mhorn_2^1$ are exactly the nerves of bicategories. At the other extreme, where <i>all</i> 2 and 1-simplices are invertible, are those Kan complexes in which the Kan conditions are satisfied exactly in all dimensions >2. These are exactly the nerves of <i>bigroupoids</i> - all 2-cells are isomorphisms and all 1-cells are equivalences.

Title: A homotopy double groupoid of a Hausdorff space

Abstract: We associate to a Hausdorff space, $ X $, a double groupoid, $ \mbox{\boldmath $ \rho $}^{\square}_{2} (X) $, the <i>homotopy double groupoid</i> of $ X $. The construction is based on the geometric notion of <i>thin square</i>. Under the equivalence of categories between small $ 2 $-categories and double categories with connection the homotopy double groupoid corresponds to the <i>homotopy</i> 2-<i> groupoid</i>, $ {\bf G}_{2} (X) $. The cubical nature of $ \mbox{\boldmath $ \rho $}^{\square}_{2} (X) $ as opposed to the globular nature of $ {\bf G}_{2} (X) $ should provide a convenient tool when handling `local-to-global' problems as encountered in a generalised van Kampen theorem and dealing with tensor products and enrichments of the category of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces.

Title: Entity-relationship-attribute designs and sketches
Authors: Michael Johnson, Robert Rosebrugh, R. J. Wood
Abstract: Entity-Relationship-Attribute ideas are commonly used to specify and design information systems. They use a graphical technique for displaying the objects of the system and relationships among them. The design process can be enhanced by specifying constraints of the system and the natural environment for these is the categorical notion of sketch. Here we argue that the finite-limit, finite-sum sketches with a terminal node are the appropriate class and call them EA sketches. A model for an EA sketch in a lextensive category is a `snapshot' of a database with values in that category. The category of models of an EA sketch is an object of models of the sketch in a 2-category of lextensive categories. Moreover, modelling the <i>same</i> sketch in certain objects in other 2-categories defines both the query language for the database and the updates (the dynamics) for the database.

Title: Homology of Lie algebras with $\Lambda/q\Lambda$ coefficients and exact sequences
Authors: Emzar Khmaladze
Abstract: Using the long exact sequence of nonabelian derived functors, an eight term exact sequence of Lie algebra homology with $\Lambda/q\Lambda$ coefficients is obtained, where $\Lambda$ is a ground ring and $q$ is a nonnegative integer. Hopf formulas for the second and third homology of a Lie algebra are proved. The condition for the existence and the description of the universal $q$-central relative extension of a Lie epimorphism in terms of relative homologies are given.

Authors: Robert Rosebrugh, R. J. Wood
Abstract: For the 2-monad $((-)^2,I,C)$ on <b>CAT</b>, with unit $I$ described by identities and multiplication $C$ described by composition, we show that a functor $F : {\cal K}^2 \rightarrow \cal K$ satisfying $FI_{\cal K} = 1_{\cal K}$ admits a unique, normal, pseudo-algebra structure for $(-)^2$ if and only if there is a mere natural isomorphism $F F^2 \rightarrow F C_{\cal K}$. We show that when this is the case the set of all natural transformations $F F^2 \rightarrow F C_{\cal K}$ forms a commutative monoid isomorphic to the centre of $\cal K$.

Title: More on injectivity in locally presentable categories
Authors: J. Rosicky, J. Adamek, F. Borceux
Abstract: Injectivity with respect to morphisms having $\lambda$-presentable domains and codomains is characterized: such injectivity classes are precisely those closed under products, $\lambda$-directed colimits, and $\lambda$-pure subobjects. This sharpens the result of the first two authors (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 336 (1993), 785-804). In contrast, for geometric logic an example is found of a class closed under directed colimits and pure subobjects, but not axiomatizable by a geometric theory. A more technical characterization of axiomatizable classes in geometric logic is presented.

Abstract: We investigate the effect on Cauchy complete objects of the change of base 2-functor ${\cal V}-Cat \rightarrow {\cal W}-Cat$ induced by a two-sided enrichment ${\cal V} \rightarrow {\cal W}$. We restrict our study to the case of locally partially ordered bases. The reversibility notion introduced by Walters is extended to two-sided enrichments and Cauchy completion. We show that a reversible left adjoint two-sided enrichment $F: {\cal V} \rightarrow {\cal W}$ between locally partially ordered reversible bicategories induces an adjunction $F_{\sim} \dashv F^{\sim}: \VSkCRcCat \rightharpoonup \WSkCRcCat$ between sub-categories of skeletal and Cauchy-reversible complete enrichments.

Title: Sober spaces and continuations
Authors: Paul Taylor
Abstract: A topological space is sober if it has exactly the points that are dictated by its open sets. We explain the analogy with the way in which computational values are determined by the observations that can be made of them. A new definition of sobriety is formulated in terms of lambda calculus and elementary category theory, with no reference to lattice structure, but, for topological spaces, this coincides with the standard lattice-theoretic definition. The primitive symbolic and categorical structures are extended to make their types sober. For the natural numbers, the additional structure provides definition by description and general recursion.

Finally, the theory of multicategories and a generalization of structure and semantics are used to identify the categories of algebras of Hopf monads.

Title: Categorical models and quasigroup homotopies
Authors: George Voutsadakis
Abstract: In many applications of quasigroups isotopies and homotopies are more important than isomorphisms and homomorphisms. In this paper, the way homotopies may arise in the context of categorical quasigroup model theory is investigated. In this context, the algebraic structures are specified by diagram-based logics, such as sketches, and categories of models become functor categories. An idea, pioneered by Gvaramiya and Plotkin, is used to give a construction of a model category naturally equivalent to the category of quasigroups with homotopies between them.

Title: Morphisms and modules for poly-bicategories
Authors: J. R. B. Cockett, J. Koslowski, R. A. G. Seely
Abstract: Linear bicategories are a generalization of ordinary bicategories in which there are two horizontal (1-cell) compositions corresponding to the ``tensor'' and ``par'' of linear logic. Benabou's notion of a morphism (lax 2-functor) of bicategories may be generalized to linear bicategories, where they are called linear functors. Unfortunately, as for the bicategorical case, it is not obvious how to organize linear functors smoothly into a higher dimensional structure. Not only do linear functors seem to lack the two compositions expected for a linear bicategory but, even worse, they inherit from the bicategorical level the failure to combine well with the obvious notion of transformation. As we shall see, there are also problems with lifting the notion of lax transformation to the linear setting. <p> One possible resolution is to step up one dimension, taking morphisms as the 0-cell level. In the linear setting, this suggests making linear functors 0-cells, but what structure should sit above them? Lax transformations in a suitable sense just do not seem to work very well for this purpose (Section \ref{S:linnattran}). Modules provide a more promising direction, but raise a number of technical issues concerning the composability of both the modules and their transformations. In general the required composites will not exist in either the linear bicategorical or ordinary bicategorical setting. However, when these composites do exist modules between linear functors do combine to form a linear bicategory. In order to better understand the conditions for the existence of composites, we have found it convenient, particularly in the linear setting, to develop the theory of ``poly-bicategories''. In this setting we can develop the theory so as to extract the answers to these problems not only for linear bicategories but also for ordinary bicategories. Poly-bicategories are 2-dimensional generalizations of Szabo's poly-categories, consisting of objects, 1-cells, and poly-2-cells. The latter may have several 1-cells as input and as output and can be composed by means of cutting along a single 1-cell. While a poly-bicategory does not require that there be any compositions for the 1-cells, such composites are determined (up to 1-cell isomorphism) by their universal properties. We say a poly-bicategory is representable when there is a representing 1-cell for each of the two possible 1-cell compositions geared towards the domains and codomains of the poly 2-cells. In this case we recover the notion of a linear bicategory. The poly notions of functors, modules and their transformations are introduced as well. The poly-functors between two given poly-bicategories <b>P</b> and <b>P'</b> together with poly-modules between poly-functors and their transformations form a new poly-bicategory provided <b>P</b> is representable and closed in the sense that every 1-cell has both a left and a right adjoint (in the appropriate linear sense). Finally we revisit the notion of linear (or lax) natural transformations, which can only be defined for representable poly-bicategories. These in fact correspond to modules having special properties.

Title: The branching nerve of HDA and the Kan condition
Authors: Philippe Gaucher
Abstract: One can associate to any strict globular $\omega$-category three augmented simplicial nerves called the globular nerve, the branching and the merging semi-cubical nerves. If this strict globular $\omega$-category is freely generated by a precubical set, then the corresponding homology theories contain different informations about the geometry of the higher dimensional automaton modeled by the precubical set. Adding inverses in this $\omega$-category to any morphism of dimension greater than 2 and with respect to any composition laws of dimension greater than 1 does not change these homology theories. In such a framework, the globular nerve always satisfies the Kan condition. On the other hand, both branching and merging nerves never satisfy it, except in some very particular and uninteresting situations. In this paper, we introduce two new nerves (the branching and merging semi-globular nerves) satisfying the Kan condition and having conjecturally the same simplicial homology as the branching and merging semi-cubical nerves respectively in such framework. The latter conjecture is related to the thin elements conjecture already introduced in our previous papers.

Title: Isomorphisms between left and right adjoints
Authors: H. Fausk, P. Hu, J. P. May
Abstract: There are many contexts in algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and homological algebra where one encounters a functor that has both a left and right adjoint, with the right adjoint being isomorphic to a shift of the left adjoint specified by an appropriate `dualizing object'. Typically the left adjoint is well understood while the right adjoint is more mysterious, and the result identifies the right adjoint in familiar terms. We give a categorical discussion of such results. One essential point is to differentiate between the classical framework that arises in algebraic geometry and a deceptively similar, but genuinely different, framework that arises in algebraic topology. Another is to make clear which parts of the proofs of such results are formal. The analysis significantly simplifies the proofs of particular cases, as we illustrate in a sequel discussing applications to equivariant stable homotopy theory.

Abstract: The homotopy classification of graded categorical groups and their homomorphisms is applied, in this paper, to obtain appropriate treatments for diverse crossed product constructions with operators which appear in several algebraic contexts. Precise classification theorems are therefore stated for equivariant extensions by groups either of monoids, or groups, or rings, or rings-groups or algebras as well as for graded Clifford systems with operators, equivariant Azumaya algebras over Galois extensions of commutative rings and for strongly graded bialgebras and Hopf algebras with operators. These specialized classifications follow from the theory of graded categorical groups after identifying, in each case, adequate systems of factor sets with graded monoidal functors to suitable graded categorical groups associated to the structure dealt with. <p> Keywords: graded categorical group, graded monoidal functor, equivariant group cohomology, crossed product, factor set, monoid extension, group extension, ring-group extension, Clifford system, Azumaya algebra, graded bialgebra, graded Hopf algebra

This concept is closely related to the continuous categories of P. T. Johnstone and A.

Authors: Michael Barr, W. D. Burgess, R. Raphael
Abstract: This paper studies the homomorphism of rings of continuous functions $\rho : C(X)\to C(Y)$, $Y$ a subspace of a Tychonoff space $X$, induced by restriction. We ask when $\rho$ is an epimorphism in the categorical sense. There are several appropriate categories: we look at <b>CR</b>, all commutative rings, and <b>R/N</b>, all reduced commutative rings. When $X$ is first countable and perfectly normal (e.g., a metric space), $\rho$ is a <b>CR</b> -epimorphism if and only if it is a <b>R/N</b>-epimorphism if and only if $Y$ is locally closed in $X$. It is also shown that the restriction of $\rho$ to $C^*(X)\to C^*(Y)$, when $X$ is normal, is a <b>CR</b>-epimorphism if and only if it is a surjection.

Abstract: We introduce various notions of <i>partial topos</i>, i.e. `topos without terminal object'.

Local toposes satisfy all the usual exactness properties of toposes but are neither cartesian closed nor have a subobject classifier. Examples for the weaker notions are local homeomorphisms and discrete fibrations. Finally, for partial toposes with supports we show how they can be completed to toposes via an inverse limit construction. <p> Keywords: fibred categories, partial toposes

Title: Modules
Authors: J. R. B. Cockett, J. Koslowski, R. A. G. Seely, R. J. Wood
Abstract: This paper studies lax higher dimensional structure over bicategories. The general notion of a module between two morphisms of bicategories is described. These modules together with their (multi-)2-cells, which we call modulations, organize themselves into a multi-bicategory. The usual notion of a module can be recovered from this general notion by simply choosing the domain bicategory to be the terminal or final bicategory. <p> The composite of two such modules need not exist. However, when the domain bicategory is small and the codomain bicategory is locally cocomplete then the composite of any two modules does exist and has a simple construction using the local colimits. These modules and their modulations then give rise to a bicategory. <p> Recall that neither transformations nor optransformations (respectively lax natural transformations and oplax natural transformations) between morphisms of bicategories give rise to a smooth 3-dimensional structure. However, there is a smooth 3-dimensional structure for modules, and both transformations and optransformations give rise to associated modules. Furthermore, the modulations between two modules associated with transformations can then be described directly as a new sort of modification between the transformations. This provides a locally full and faithful homomorphism from transformations and modifications into the bicategory of modules. <p> Finally, if each 1-cell component of a transformation is a left-adjoint then the right-adjoints provide an optransformation. In the module bicategory the module associated with this optransformation is right-adjoint to the module associated with the transformation. Therefore the inclusion of transformations whose 1-cells have left adjoints into the (multi-)bicategory of modules provides a source of proarrow equipment. <p> Keywords: module, bicategory, transformation

Title: Symmetric monoidal completions and the exponential principle among labeled combinatorial structures
Authors: Matias Menni
Abstract: We generalize Dress and M&uuml;ller's main result in <i>Decomposable functors and the exponential principle</i>. We observe that their result can be seen as a characterization of free algebras for certain monad on the category of species. This perspective allows to formulate a general <i> exponential principle</i> in a symmetric monoidal category. We show that for any groupoid <b>G</b>, the category of presheaves on the symmetric monoidal completion <b>!G</b> of <b>G</b> satisfies the exponential principle. The main result in Dress and M&uuml;ller reduces to the case <b>G</b> = 1. We discuss two notions of functor between categories satisfying the exponential principle and express some well known combinatorial identities as instances of the preservation properties of these functors. Finally, we give a characterization of <b>G</b> as a subcategory of presheaves on <b>!G</b>. <p> Keywords: symmetric monoidal categories, combinatorics

Title: Composition-Representative Subsets
Authors: Gary Griffing
Abstract: A specific property applicable to subsets of a hom-set in any small category is defined. Subsets with this property are called <i>composition-representative</i>. The notion of composition-representability is motivated both by the representability of a linear functional on an associative algebra, and, by the recognizability of a subset of a monoid. Various characterizations are provided which therefore may be regarded as analogs of certain characterizations for representability and recognizablity. As an application, the special case of an algebraic theory <i>T</i> is considered and simple characterizations for a recognizable forest are given. In particular, it is shown that the composition-representative subsets of the hom-set <i/>T</i>([1],[0]), the set of all trees, are the recognizable forests and that they, in turn, are characterized by a corresponding finite `syntactic congruence.' Using a decomposition result (proved here), the composition-representative subsets of the hom-set <i>T</i>([<i>m</i>],[0]), (0 \leq <i>m</i>) are shown to be finite unions of <i>m</i>-fold (cartesian) products of recognizable forests. <p> Keywords: recognizable language, recognizable forest, representative functional, syntactic congruence, algebraic theory, translates

Abstract: Codescent morphisms are described in regular categories which satisfy the so-called strong amalgamation property. Among varieties of universal algebras possessing this property are, as is known, categories of groups, not necessarily associative rings, <i>M</i>-sets (for a monoid <i>M</i>), Lie algebras (over a field), quasi-groups, commutative quasi-groups, Steiner quasi-groups, medial quasi-groups, semilattice$lattices, weakly associative lattices, Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras.

Title: Baer invariants in semi-abelian categories I: General theory
Authors: T. Everaert, T. Van der Linden
Abstract: Extending the work of Fr&ouml;hlich, Lue and Furtado-Coelho, we consider the theory of Baer invariants in the context of semi-abelian categories. Several exact sequences, relative to a subfunctor of the identity functor, are obtained. We consider a notion of commutator which, in the case of abelianization, corresponds to Smith's. The resulting notion of centrality fits into Janelidze and Kelly's theory of central extensions. Finally we propose a notion of nilpotency, relative to a Birkhoff subcategory of a semi-abelian category.

Title: Operads in higher-dimensional category theory
Authors: Tom Leinster
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to set up a theory of generalized operads and multicategories and to use it as a language in which to propose a definition of weak n-category. Included is a full explanation of why the proposed definition of n-category is a reasonable one, and of what happens when n is less than or equal to 2. Generalized operads and multicategories play other parts in higher-dimensional algebra too, some of which are outlined here: for instance, they can be used to simplify the opetopic approach to n-categories expounded by Baez, Dolan and others, and are a natural language in which to discuss enrichment of categorical structures.

Title: Baer invariants in semi-abelian categories II: Homology
Authors: T. Everaert, T. Van der Linden
Abstract: This article treats the problem of deriving the reflector of a semi-abelian category $\cal A$ onto a Birkhoff subcategory $\cal B$ of $\cal A$. Basing ourselves on Carrasco, Cegarra and Grandjean's homology theory for crossed modules, we establish a connection between our theory of Baer invariants with a generalization---to semi-abelian categories---of Barr and Beck's cotriple homology theory. This results in a semi-abelian version of Hopf's formula and the Stallings-Stammbach sequence from group homology.

Title: Notions of flatness relative to a Grothendieck topology
Authors: Panagis Karazeris
Abstract: Completions of (small) categories under certain kinds of colimits and exactness conditions have been studied extensively in the literature. When the category that we complete is not left exact but has some weaker kind of limit for finite diagrams, the universal property of the completion is usually stated with respect to functors that enjoy a property reminiscent of flatness. In this fashion notions like that of a left covering or a multilimit merging functor have appeared in the literature. We show here that such notions coincide with flatness when the latter is interpreted relative to (the internal logic of) a site structure associated to the target category. We exploit this in order to show that the left Kan extensions of such functors, along the inclusion of their domain into its completion, are left exact. This gives in a very economical and uniform manner the universal property of such completions. Our result relies heavily on some unpublished work of A. Kock from 1989. We further apply this to give a pretopos completion process for small categories having a weak finite limit property.

Title: Vertically iterated classical enrichment
Authors: Stefan Forcey
Abstract: Lyubashenko has described enriched 2-categories as categories enriched over V-Cat, the 2-category of categories enriched over a symmetric monoidal V. This construction is the strict analogue for V-functors in V-Cat of Brian Day's probicategories for V-modules in V-Mod. Here I generalize the strict version to enriched n-categories for k-fold monoidal V. The latter is defined as by Balteanu, Fiedorowicz, Schwanzl and Vogt but with the addition of making visible the coherent associators. The symmetric case can easily be recovered. This paper proposes a recursive definition of V-n-categories and their morphisms. We show that for V k-fold monoidal the structure of a (k-n)-fold monoidal strict (n+1)-category is possessed by V-n-Cat. This article is a completion of the work begun by the author in the preprint entitled Higher dimensional enrichment (math.CT/0306086), and the initial sections duplicate the beginning of that paper.

Abstract: The paper develops the previously proposed approach to constructing factorization systems in general categories. This approach is applied to the problem of finding conditions under which a functor (not necessarily admitting a right adjoint) `reflects' factorization systems. In particular, a generalization of the well-known Cassidy-H&eacute;ebert-Kelly factorization theorem is given. The problem of relating a factorization system to a pointed endofunctor is considered. Some relevant examples in concrete categories are given.

Title: $\K$-purity and orthogonality
Authors: Michel Hebert
Abstract: Adamek and Sousa recently solved the problem of characterizing the subcategories <i>K</i> of a locally $\lambda$-presentable category <i>C</i> which are $\lambda$-orthogonal in <i>C</i>, using their concept of <i>K</i>$\lambda$-pure morphism. We strengthen the latter definition, in order to obtain a characterization of the classes defined by orthogonality with respect to $\lambda$-presentable morphisms (where $f : A \rightarrow B is called $\lambda$-presentable if it is a $\lambda$-presentable object of the comma category A/<i>C</i>). Those classes are natural examples of reflective subcategories defined by proper classes of morphisms. Adamek and Sousa's result follows from ours. We also prove that $\lambda$-presentable morphisms are precisely the pushouts of morphisms between $\lambda$-presentable objects of <i>C</i>.

Authors: Steven Vickers
Abstract: If <i>X</i> is a locale, then its double powerlocale P<i>X</i> is defined to be PU(PL(<i>X</i>)) where PU and PL are the upper and lower powerlocale constructions. We prove various results relating it to exponentiation of locales, including the following. First, if <i>X</i> is a locale for which the exponential <i>S</i>^<i>X</i> exists (where <i>S</i> is the Sierpinski locale), then P<i>X</i> is an exponential <i>S</i>^(<i>S</i>^<i>X</i>). Second, if in addition <i>W</i> is a locale for which P<i>W</i> is homeomorphic to <i>S</i>^<i>X</i>, then <i>X</i> is an exponential <i>S</i>^<i>W</i>. <p> The work uses geometric reasoning, i.e. reasoning stable under pullback along geometric morphisms, and this enables the locales to be discussed in terms of their points as though they were spaces. It relies on a number of geometricity results including those for locale presentations and for powerlocales.

Title: Higher-dimensional algebra V: 2-Groups
Authors: John C. Baez, Aaron D. Lauda
Abstract: A 2-group is a `categorified' version of a group, in which the underlying set G has been replaced by a category and the multiplication map m ; G x G -> G has been replaced by a functor. Various versions of this notion have already been explored; our goal here is to provide a detailed introduction to two, which we call `weak' and `coherent' 2-groups. A weak 2-group is a weak monoidal category in which every morphism has an inverse and every object x has a `weak inverse': an object y such that x \tensor y \iso 1 \iso y \tensor x. A coherent 2-group is a weak 2-group in which every object x is equipped with a <i> specified</i> weak inverse x' and isomorphisms i_x : 1 -> x \tensor x', e_x : x' \tensor x -> 1 forming an adjunction. We describe 2-categories of weak and coherent 2-groups and an `improvement' 2-functor that turns weak 2-groups into coherent ones, and prove that this 2-functor is a 2-equivalence of 2-categories. We internalize the concept of coherent 2-group, which gives a quick way to define Lie 2-groups. We give a tour of examples, including the `fundamental 2-group' of a space and various Lie 2-groups. We also explain how coherent 2-groups can be classified in terms of 3rd cohomology classes in group cohomology. Finally, using this classification, we construct for any connected and simply-connected compact simple Lie group G a family of 2-groups G_h (h in Z) having G as its group of objects and U(1) as the group of automorphisms of its identity object. These 2-groups are built using Chern-Simons theory, and are closely related to the Lie 2-algebras g_h (h in R) described in a companion paper.

Title: Higher-Dimensional Algebra VI: Lie 2-Algebras
Authors: John C. Baez, Alissa S. Crans
Abstract: The theory of Lie algebras can be categorified starting from a new notion of `2-vector space', which we define as an internal category in Vect. There is a 2-category 2Vect having these 2-vector spaces as objects, `linear functors' as morphisms and `linear natural transformations' as 2-morphisms. We define a `semistrict Lie 2-algebra' to be a 2-vector space L equipped with a skew-symmetric bilinear functor [ . , . ] : L x L -> L satisfying the Jacobi identity up to a completely antisymmetric trilinear natural transformation called the `Jacobiator', which in turn must satisfy a certain law of its own. This law is closely related to the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation, and indeed we prove that any semistrict Lie 2-algebra gives a solution of this equation, just as any Lie algebra gives a solution of the Yang--Baxter equation. We construct a 2-category of semistrict Lie 2-algebras and prove that it is 2-equivalent to the 2-category of 2-term L_\infty-algebras in the sense of Stasheff. We also study strict and skeletal Lie 2-algebras, obtaining the former from strict Lie 2-groups and using the latter to classify Lie 2-algebras in terms of 3rd cohomology classes in Lie algebra cohomology. This classification allows us to construct for any finite-dimensional Lie algebra g a canonical 1-parameter family of Lie 2-algebras g_h which reduces to g at h = 0. These are closely related to the 2-groups G_h constructed in a companion paper.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the categorical group of derivations, Der(G, A), from a categorical group G into a braided categorical group (A,c) equipped with a given coherent left action of G. Categorical groups provide a 2-dimensional vision of groups and so this object is a sort of 0-cohomology at a higher level for categorical groups. We show that the functor Der(-, A) is corepresentable by the semidirect product of A with G and that Der(G,-) preserves homotopy kernels. Well-known cohomology groups, and exact sequences relating these groups, in several different contexts are then obtained as examples of this general theory.

Title: Normed combinatorial homology and noncommutative tori
Authors: Marco Grandis
Abstract: Cubical sets have a <i>directed homology,</i> studied in a previous paper and consisting of <i>preordered abelian groups,</i> with a positive cone generated by the structural cubes. By this additional information, cubical sets can provide a sort of `noncommutative topology', agreeing with some results of noncommutative geometry but lacking the metric aspects of C* -algebras. Here, we make such similarity stricter by introducing <i>normed</i> cubical sets and their <i>normed</i> directed homology, formed of normed preordered abelian groups. The normed cubical sets NC_\theta associated with `irrational' rotations have thus the same classification up to isomorphism as the well-known irrational rotation C* -algebras A_\theta.

Abstract: A PROP is a way of encoding structure borne by an object of a symmetric monoidal category. We describe a notion of <i>distributive law</i> for PROPs, based on Beck's distributive laws for monads. A distributive law between PROPs allows them to be composed, and an algebra for the composite PROP consists of a single object with an algebra structure for each of the original PROPs, subject to compatibility conditions encoded by the distributive law. An example is the PROP for bialgebras, which is a composite of the PROP for coalgebras and that for algebras.

Title: Split structures
Authors: Robert Rosebrugh, R. J. Wood
Abstract: In the early 1990's the authors proved that the full subcategory of `sup-lattices' determined by the constructively completely distributive (CCD) lattices is equivalent to the idempotent splitting completion of the bicategory of sets and relations. Having many corollaries, this was an extremely useful result. Moreover, as the authors soon suspected, it specializes a much more general result. <p> Let D be a monad on a category C in which idempotents split. Write kar(C_D) for the idempotent splitting completion of the Kleisli category. Write spl(C^D) for the category whose objects are pairs ((L,s),t), where (L,s) is an object of the Eilenberg-Moore category for D, and t is a <i>homomorphism</i> that splits s, with spl(C^D)(((L,s),t),((L',s'),t'))=C^D((L,s)(L',s')). <p> The main result is that kar(C_D) is isomorphic to spl(C^D).

Title: The monoidal centre as a limit
Authors: Ross Street
Abstract: The centre of a monoidal category is a braided monoidal category. Monoidal categories are monoidal objects (or pseudomonoids) in the monoidal bicategory of categories. This paper provides a universal construction in a braided monoidal bicategory that produces a braided monoidal object from any monoidal object. Some properties and sufficient conditions for existence of the construction are examined.

Title: Internal monotone-light factorization for categories via preorders
Authors: Joao Xarez
Abstract: It is shown that, for a finitely-complete category C with coequalizers of kernel pairs, if every product-regular epi is also stably-regular then there exist the reflections <b>(R)Grphs</b>(C) --> <b>(R)Rel</b>(C), from (reflexive) graphs into (reflexive) relations in C, and <b>Cat</b>(C) --> <b>Preord</b>(C), from categories into preorders in C. Furthermore, such a sufficient condition ensures as well that these reflections do have stable units. This last property is equivalent to the existence of a monotone-light factorization system, provided there are <i>sufficiently many</i> effective descent morphisms with domain in the respective full subcategory. In this way, we have internalized the monotone-light factorization for small categories via preordered sets, associated with the reflection <b>Cat</b> --> <b>Preord</b>, which is now just the special case C = <b>Set</b>.

Title: Categorical structures enriched in a quantaloid: categories, distributors and functors
Authors: Isar Stubbe
Abstract: We thoroughly treat several familiar and less familiar definitions and results concerning categories, functors and distributors enriched in a base quantaloid Q. In analogy with V-category theory we discuss such things as adjoint functors, (pointwise) left Kan extensions, weighted (co)limits, presheaves and free (co)completion, Cauchy completion and Morita equivalence. With an appendix on the universality of the quantaloid Dist(Q) of Q-enriched categories and distributors.

Title: On essential ring embeddings and the epimorphic hull of C(X)
Authors: R. Raphael, R. G. Woods
Abstract: Storrer introduced the epimorphic hull of a commutative semiprime ring R and showed that it is (up to isomorphism) the unique essential epic von Neumann regular extension of R. In the case when R = C(X) with X a Tychonoff space, we show that the embedding induced by a dense subspace of X is always essential. This simplifies the search for spaces whose epimorphic hull is a full ring of continuous functions, and allows us to obtain new examples where this occurs. The main theorem comes close to a characterisation of this phenomenon.

Title: Absolute homology
Authors: Michael Barr
Abstract: Call two maps, f,g from C to C', of chain complexes absolutely homologous if for any additive functor F, the induced Ff and Fg are homologous (induce the same map on homology). It is known that the identity is absolutely homologous to 0 iff it is homotopic to 0 and tempting to conjecture that f and g are absolutely homologous iff they are homotopic. This conjecture is false, but there is an equational characterization of absolute homology. I also characterize left absolute and right absolute (in which F is quantified over left or right exact functors).

Abstract: The relationships between thin elements, commutative shells and connections in cubical omega-categories are explored by a method which does not involve the use of pasting theory or nerves of omega-categories (both of which were previously needed for this purpose; see Al-Agl, Brown and Steiner, Section 9). It is shown that composites of commutative shells are commutative and that thin structures are equivalent to appropriate sets of connections; this work extends to all dimensions the results proved in dimensions 2 and 3 in Brown, Kamps and Porter and Brown and Mosa.

Authors: Paul Blain Levy
Abstract: Call-by-push-value is a "semantic machine code", providing a set of simple primitives from which both the call-by-value and call-by-name paradigms are built. We present its operational semantics as a stack machine, suggesting a term judgement of stacks. We then see that CBPV, incorporating these stack terms, has a simple categorical semantics based on an adjunction between values and stacks. There are no coherence requirements.

Title: Abstract Physical Traces
Authors: Samson Abramsky, Bob Coecke
Abstract: We revise our `Physical Traces' paper in the light of the results in [Abramsky and Coecke LiCS`04]. The key fact is that the notion of a <i>strongly compact closed category</i> allows abstract notions of adjoint, bipartite projector and inner product to be defined, and their key properties to be proved. In this paper we improve on the definition of strong compact closure as compared to the one presented in [Abramsky and Coecke LiCS`04]. This modification enables an elegant characterization of strong compact closure in terms of adjoints and a Yanking axiom, and a better treatment of bipartite projectors.

Title: A MONADIC APPROACH TO POLYCATEGORIES
Authors: Juergen Koslowski
Abstract: In the quest for an elegant formulation of the notion of ``polycategory'' we develop a more symmetric counterpart to Burroni's notion of ``T- category'', where T is a cartesian monad on a category X with pullbacks. Our approach involves two such monads, S and T, that are linked by a suitable generalization of a distributive law in the sense of Beck. This takes the form of a span omega : TS <--> ST in the functor category [X,X] and guarantees essential associativity for a canonical pullback-induced composition of S-T-spans over X, identifying them as the 1-cells of a bicategory, whose (internal) monoids then qualify as ``omega-categories''. In case that S and T both are the free monoid monad on set, we construct an omega utilizing an apparently new classical distributive law linking the free semigroup monad with itself. Our construction then gives rise to so-called ``planar polycategories'', which nowadays seem to be of more intrinsic interest than Szabo's original polycategories. Weakly cartesian monads on X may be accommodated as well by first quotienting the bicategory of X-spans.

Title: Canonical and op-canonical lax algebras
Authors: Gavin J. Seal
Abstract: The definition of a category of (T,V)-algebras, where V is a unital commutative quantale and T is a Set-monad, requires the existence of a certain lax extension of T. In this article, we present a general construction of such an extension. This leads to the formation of two categories of (T,V)-algebras: the category Alg(T,V) of <i>canonical </i>(T,V)<i>-algebras</i>, and the category Alg(T',V) of <i>op-canonical </i>(T,V)<i>-algebras</i>. The usual topological-like examples of categories of (T,V)-algebras (preordered sets, topological, metric and approach spaces) are obtained in this way, and the category of closure spaces appears as a category of canonical (P,V)-algebras, where P is the powerset monad. This unified presentation allows us to study how these categories are related, and it is shown that under suitable hypotheses both Alg(T,V) and Alg(T',V) embed coreflectively into Alg(P,V).

Title: On the representability of actions in a semi-abelian category
Authors: F. Borceux, G. Janelidze, G. M. Kelly
Abstract: We consider a semi-abelian category V and we write Act(G,X) for the set of actions of the object G on the object X, in the sense of the theory of semi-direct products in V. We investigate the representability of the functor Act(-,X) in the case where V is locally presentable, with finite limits commuting with filtered colimits. This contains all categories of models of a semi-abelian theory in a Grothendieck topos, thus in particular all semi-abelian varieties of universal algebra. For such categories, we prove first that the representability of Act(-,X) reduces to the preservation of binary coproducts. Next we give both a very simple necessary condition and a very simple sufficient condition, in terms of amalgamation properties, for the preservation of binary coproducts by the functor Act(-,X) in a general semi-abelian category. Finally, we exhibit the precise form of the more involved ``if and only if'' amalgamation property corresponding to the representability of actions: this condition is in particular related to a new notion of ``normalization of a morphism''. We provide also a wide supply of algebraic examples and counter-examples, giving in particular evidence of the relevance of the object representing Act(-,X), when it turns out to exist.

Abstract: A precise concept of concrete geometrical category is introduced in an axiomatic way. To any algebra L for an many-sorted infinitary algebraic theory <b>T</b> is associated a concrete geometrical category <b>Geo</b>(L), the so-called classifying concrete geometrical category of L, satisfying a universal property. The terminology "geometrical" is justified firstly for <b>Geo</b>(L) and secondly for any concrete geometrical category by proving that they are all classifying ones. The legitimate category <b>CGC</b> of concrete geometrical categories is build up and proved to be the dual of the legitimate category <b>TGC</b> of topological geometrical categories.

Title: Notes on enriched categories with colimits of some class
Authors: G. M. Kelly, V. Schmitt
Abstract: The paper is in essence a survey of categories having $\phi$-weighted colimits for all the weights $\phi$ in some class $\Phi$. We introduce the class $\Phi^+$ of $\Phi$-<i>flat</i> weights which are those $\psi$ for which $\psi$-colimits commute in the base $\cal V$ with limits having weights in $\Phi$; and the class $\Phi^-$ of $\Phi$-<i>atomic</i> weights, which are those $\psi$ for which $\psi$-limits commute in the base $\cal V$ with colimits having weights in $\Phi$. We show that both these classes are <i>saturated</i> (that is, what was called <i>closed</i> in the terminology of Albert and Kelly). We prove that for the class $\cal P$ of <i>all</i> weights, the classes $\cal P^+$ and $\cal P^-$ both coincide with the class $\Q$ of <i>absolute</i> weights. For any class $\Phi$ and any category $\cal A$, we have the free $\Phi$-cocompletion $\Phi(\cal A)$ of $\cal A$; and we recognize $\cal Q(\cal A)$ as the Cauchy-completion of $\cal A$. We study the equivalence between ${(\cal Q(\cal A^{op}))}^{op}$ and $\cal Q(\cal A)$, which we exhibit as the restriction of the Isbell adjunction between ${[\cal A,\cal V]}^{op}$ and $[\cal A^{op},\cal V]$ when $\cal A$ is small; and we give a new Morita theorem for any class $\Phi$ containing $\cal Q$. We end with the study of $\Phi$-continuous weights and their relation to the $\Phi$-flat weights.

We will show that if a model category $\cal K$ is suitably determined by $\lambda$-small objects then its homotopy category $Ho(\cal K)$ is approximated by cohomology functors defined on those $\lambda$-small objects. In the case of simplicial sets, we have $\lambda = \omega_1$, i.e., $\lambda$-small means countable.

Title: Reflective Kleisli subcategories of the category of Eilenberg-Moore algebras for factorization monads
Authors: Marcelo Fiore, Matias Menni
Abstract: It is well known that for any monad, the associated Kleisli category is embedded in the category of Eilenberg-Moore algebras as the free ones. We discovered some interesting examples in which this embedding is reflective; that is, it has a left adjoint. To understand this phenomenon we introduce and study a class of monads arising from factorization systems, and thereby termed factorization monads. For them we show that under some simple conditions on the factorization system the free algebras are a full reflective subcategory of the algebras. We provide various examples of this situation of a combinatorial nature.

Title: The shape of a category up to directed homotopy
Authors: Marco Grandis
Abstract: This work is a contribution to a recent field, Directed Algebraic Topology. Categories which appear as fundamental categories of `directed structures', e.g. ordered topological spaces, have to be studied up to appropriate notions of <i>directed homotopy equivalence</i>, which are more general than ordinary equivalence of categories. Here we introduce <i> past</i> and <i> future equivalences </i> of categories - sort of symmetric versions of an adjunction - and use them and their combinations to get `directed models' of a category; in the simplest case, these are the join of the <i>least full reflective</i> and the <i>least full coreflective</i> subcategory.

Authors: S. Awodey, H. Forssell
Abstract: This paper constructs models of intuitionistic set theory in suitable categories. First, a Basic Intuitionistic Set Theory (BIST) is stated, and the categorical semantics are given. Second, we give a notion of an <i>ideal</i> over a category, using which one can build a model of BIST in which a given topos occurs as the sets. And third, a sheaf model is given of a Basic Intuitionistic Class Theory conservatively extending BIST. The paper extends the results in Awodey, Butz, Simpson and Streicher (2003) by introducing a new and perhaps more natural notion of ideal, and in the class theory of part three.

Title: A Galois theory with stable units for simplicial sets
Authors: Joao J. Xarez
Abstract: We recall and reformulate certain known constructions, in order to make a convenient setting for obtaining generalized monotone-light factorizations in the sense of A. Carboni, G. Janelidze, G. M. Kelly and R. Par&eacute;. This setting is used to study the existence of monotone-light factorizations both in categories of simplicial objects and in categories of internal categories. It is shown that there is a non-trivial monotone-light factorization for simplicial sets, such that the monotone-light factorization for reflexive graphs via reflexive relations is a special case of it, obtained by truncation. More generally, we will show that there exists a monotone-light factorization associated with every full subcategory <i>Mono(F_n)</i>, <i>n >= 0</i>, consisting of all simplicial sets whose unit morphisms are monic for the localization $F_n:\mathbf{Set}^{\Delta^{op}}\rightarrow\mathbf{Set}^{\Delta^{op}_n}$, which truncates each simplicial set after the object of n-simplices. The monotone-light factorization for categories via preorders is as well derived from the proposed setting. We also show that, for regular Mal'cev categories, the reflection of internal groupoids into internal equivalence relations necessarily produces monotone-light factorizations. It turns out that all these reflections do have stable units, in the sense of C. Cassidy, M. H&eacute;bert and G. M. Kelly, giving rise to Galois theories.

Title: Monads of effective descent type and comonadicity
Authors: Bachuki Mesablishvili
Abstract: We show, for an arbitrary adjunction $F \dashv U : \cal B \to \cal A$ with $\cal B$ Cauchy complete, that the functor $F$ is comonadic if and only if the monad $T$ on $\cal A$ induced by the adjunction is of effective descent type, meaning that the free $T$-algebra functor $F^{T}: \cal A \to \cal A^{T}$ is comonadic. This result is applied to several situations: In Section 4 to give a sufficient condition for an exponential functor on a cartesian closed category to be monadic, in Sections 5 and 6 to settle the question of the comonadicity of those functors whose domain is <b>Set</b>, or <b>Set</b>$_{\star}$, or the category of modules over a semisimple ring, in Section 7 to study the effectiveness of (co)monads on module categories. Our final application is a descent theorem for noncommutative rings from which we deduce an important result of A. Joyal and M. Tierney and of J.-P. Olivier, asserting that the effective descent morphisms in the opposite of the category of commutative unital rings are precisely the pure monomorphisms.

This property gives rise to an internal construction of the center of any object $X$, and consequently to a specific characterization of the abelian objects in $\mathbb C$.

Title: Inverting weak dihomotopy equivalence using homotopy continuous flow
Authors: Philippe Gaucher
Abstract: A flow is homotopy continuous if it is indefinitely divisible up to S-homotopy. The full subcategory of cofibrant homotopy continuous flows has nice features. Not only it is big enough to contain all dihomotopy types, but also a morphism between them is a weak dihomotopy equivalence if and only if it is invertible up to dihomotopy. Thus, the category of cofibrant homotopy continuous flows provides an implementation of Whitehead's theorem for the full dihomotopy relation, and not only for S-homotopy as in previous works of the author. This fact is not the consequence of the existence of a model structure on the category of flows because it is known that there does not exist any model structure on it whose weak equivalences are exactly the weak dihomotopy equivalences. This fact is an application of a general result for the localization of a model category with respect to a weak factorization system.

Title: Frobenius algebras and ambidextrous adjunctions
Authors: Aaron D. Lauda
Abstract: In this paper we explain the relationship between Frobenius objects in monoidal categories and adjunctions in 2-categories. Specifically, we show that every Frobenius object in a monoidal category $M$ arises from an ambijunction (simultaneous left and right adjoints) in some 2-category $\mathcal{D}$ into which $M$ fully and faithfully embeds. Since a 2D topological quantum field theory is equivalent to a commutative Frobenius algebra, this result also shows that every 2D TQFT is obtained from an ambijunction in some 2-category. Our theorem is proved by extending the theory of adjoint monads to the context of an arbitrary 2-category and utilizing the free completion under Eilenberg-Moore objects. We then categorify this theorem by replacing the monoidal category $M$ with a semistrict monoidal 2-category $M$, and replacing the 2-category $\mathcal{D}$ into which it embeds by a semistrict 3-category. To state this more powerful result, we must first define the notion of a `Frobenius pseudomonoid', which categorifies that of a Frobenius object. We then define the notion of a `pseudo ambijunction', categorifying that of an ambijunction. In each case, the idea is that all the usual axioms now hold only up to coherent isomorphism.

Title: Every Grothendieck topos has a one-way site
Authors: Colin McLarty
Abstract: Lawvere has urged a project of characterizing <i>petit</i> toposes which have the character of generalized spaces and <i>gros</i> toposes which have the character of categories of spaces. Etendues and locally decidable toposes are seemingly petit and have a natural common generalization in sites with all idempotents identities. This note shows every Grothendieck topos has such a site. More, it defines <i>slanted products</i> which take any site to an equivalent <i>one way</i> site, a site where all endomorphisms are identities. On the other hand subcanonical one-way sites are very special. A site criterion for petit toposes will probably require subcanonical sites.

Title: Points of affine categories and additivity
Authors: A. Carboni, G. Janelidze
Abstract: A category <b>C</b> is additive if and only if, for every object <i>B</i> of <b>C</b>, the category Pt(<b>C</b>,<i>B</i>) of pointed objects in the comma category (<b>C</b>,<i>B</i>) is canonically equivalent to <b>C</b>. We reformulate the proof of this known result in order to obtain a stronger one that uses not all objects of <i>B</i> of <b>C</b>, but only a conveniently defined generating class <b>S</b>. If <b>C</b> is a variety of universal algebras, then one can take <b>S</b> to be the class consisting of any single free algebra on a non-empty set.

Title: Thin fillers in the cubical nerves of omega-categories
Authors: Richard Steiner
Abstract: It is shown that the cubical nerve of a strict omega-category is a sequence of sets with cubical face operations and distinguished subclasses of thin elements satisfying certain thin filler conditions. It is also shown that a sequence of this type is the cubical nerve of a strict omega-category unique up to isomorphism; the cubical nerve functor is therefore an equivalence of categories. The sequences of sets involved are the analogues of cubical T-complexes appropriate for strict omega-categories. Degeneracies are not required in the definition of these sequences, but can in fact be constructed as thin fillers. The proof of the thin filler conditions uses chain complexes and chain homotopies.

Title: Closedness properties of internal relations II: Bourn localization
Authors: Zurab Janelidze
Abstract: We say that a class $\mathbb{D}$ of categories is the <i>Bourn localization</i> of a class $\mathbb{C}$ of categories, and we write $\mathbb{D} = \mathrm{Loc}\mathbb{C}$, if $\mathbb{D}$ is the class of all (finitely complete) categories $\mathcal{D}$ such that for each object $A$ in $\mathcal{D}$, $\mathrm{Pt}(\mathcal{D}\downarrow A) \in \mathbb{C}$, where $\mathrm{Pt}(\mathcal{D}\downarrow A)$ denotes the category of all pointed objects in the comma-category $(\mathcal{D}\downarrow A)$. As D. Bourn showed, if we take $\mathbb{D}$ to be the class of Mal'tsev categories in the sense of A. Carboni, J. Lambek, and M. C. Pedicchio, and $\mathbb{C}$ to be the class of unital categories in the sense of D. Bourn, which generalize pointed J&oacute;nsson-Tarski varieties, then $\mathbb{D} = \mathrm{Loc}(\mathbb{C})$. A similar result was obtained by the author: if $\mathbb{D}$ is as above and $\mathbb{C}$ is the class of subtractive categories, which generalize pointed subtractive varieties in the sense of A. Ursini, then $\mathbb{D} = \mathrm{Loc}(\mathbb{C})$. In the present paper we extend these results to abstract classes of categories obtained from classes of varieties. We also show that the Bourn localization of the union of the classes of unital and subtractive categories is still the class of Mal'tsev categories.

Title: Categorical structures enriched in a quantaloid: tensored and cotensored categories
Authors: Isar Stubbe
Abstract: A quantaloid is a sup-lattice-enriched category; our subject is that of categories, functors and distributors enriched in a base quantaloid $\mathcal{Q}$. We show how cocomplete $\mathcal{Q}$-categories are precisely those which are tensored and conically cocomplete, or alternatively, those which are tensored, cotensored and `order-cocomplete'. In fact, tensors and cotensors in a $\mathcal{Q}$-category determine, and are determined by, certain adjunctions in the category of $\mathcal{Q}$-categories; some of these adjunctions can be reduced to adjuctions in the category of ordered sets. Bearing this in mind, we explain how tensored $\mathcal{Q}$-categories are equivalent to order-valued closed pseudofunctors on $\mathcal{Q}^{op}$; this result is then finetuned to obtain in particular that cocomplete $\mathcal{Q}$-categories are equivalent to sup-lattice-valued homomorphisms on $\mathcal{Q}^{op}$ (a.k.a.\ $\mathcal{Q}$-modules).

Title: Stable meet semilattice fibrations and free restriction categories
Authors: J. R. B. Cockett, Xiuzhan Guo
Abstract: The construction of a free restriction category can be broken into two steps: the construction of a free stable semilattice fibration followed by the construction of a free restriction category for this fibration. Restriction categories produced from such fibrations are `unitary', in a sense which generalizes that from the theory of inverse semigroups. Characterization theorems for unitary restriction categories are derived. The paper ends with an explicit description of the free restriction category on a directed graph.

We present results both for conformal field theories defined on oriented surfaces and for theories defined on unoriented surfaces. In the latter case, in particular the so-called cross cap constraint is included.

Title: Spectra of finitely generated boolean flows
Authors: John F. Kennison
Abstract: A <b>flow</b> on a compact Hausdorff space <i>X</i> is given by a map <i> t : X --> X</i>. The general goal of this paper is to find the "cyclic parts" of such a flow. To do this, we approximate <i>(X,t)</i> by a flow on a Stone space (that is, a totally disconnected, compact Hausdorff space). Such a flow can be examined by analyzing the resulting flow on the Boolean algebra of clopen subsets, using the spectrum defined in our previous TAC paper, The cyclic spectrum of a Boolean flow. In this paper, we describe the cyclic spectrum in terms that do not rely on topos theory. We then compute the cyclic spectrum of any finitely generated Boolean flow. We define when a sheaf of Boolean flows can be regarded as cyclic and find necessary conditions for representing a Boolean flow using the global sections of such a sheaf. In the final section, we define and explore a related spectrum based on minimal subflows of Stone spaces.

Title: Paths in double categories
Authors: R. J. MacG. Dawson, R. Par&eacute;, D. A. Pronk
Abstract: Two constructions of paths in double categories are studied, providing algebraic versions of the homotopy groupoid of a space. Universal properties of these constructions are presented. The first is seen as the codomain of the universal oplax morphism of double categories and the second, which is a quotient of the first, gives the universal normal oplax morphism. Normality forces an equivalence relation on cells, a special case of which was seen before in the free adjoint construction. These constructions are the object part of 2-comonads which are shown to be oplax idempotent. The coalgebras for these comonads turn out to be Leinster's <b>fc</b>-multicategories, with representable identities in the second case.

Title: Compactifications, C(X) and ring epimorphisms
Authors: W. D. Burgess, R. Raphael
Abstract: Given a topological space $X$, $K(X)$ denotes the upper semi-lattice of its (Hausdorff) compactifications. Recent studies have asked when, for $\alpha X \in K(X)$, the restriction homomorphism $\rho : C(\alpha X) \to C(X)$ is an epimorphism in the category of commutative rings. This article continues this study by examining the sub-semilattice, $K_{epi}(X)$, of those compactifications where $\rho$ is an epimorphism along with two of its subsets, and its complement $K_{nepi}(X)$. The role of $K_z(X)\subseteq K(X)$ of those $\alpha X$ where $X$ is $z$-embedded in $\alpha X$, is also examined. The cases where $X$ is a $P$-space and, more particularly, where $X$ is discrete, receive special attention.

Title: On categorical crossed modules
Authors: P. Carrasco, A. R. Garzon, E. M. Vitale
Abstract: The well-known notion of crossed module of groups is raised in this paper to the categorical level supported by the theory of categorical groups. We construct the cokernel of a categorical crossed module and we establish the universal property of this categorical group. We also prove a suitable 2-dimensional version of the kernel-cokernel lemma for a diagram of categorical crossed modules. We then study derivations with coefficients in categorical crossed modules and show the existence of a categorical crossed module given by inner derivations. This allows us to define the low-dimensional cohomology categorical groups and, finally, these invariants are connected by a six-term 2-exact sequence obtained by using the kernel-cokernel lemma.

Title: Descent for Monads
Authors: Pieter Hofstra, Federico De Marchi
Abstract: Motivated by a desire to gain a better understanding of the ``dimension-by-dimension'' decompositions of certain prominent monads in higher category theory, we investigate descent theory for endofunctors and monads. After setting up a basic framework of indexed monoidal categories, we describe a suitable subcategory of Cat over which we can view the assignment C |-> Mnd(C) as an indexed category; on this base category, there is a natural topology. Then we single out a class of monads which are well-behaved with respect to reindexing. The main result is now, that such monads form a stack. Using this, we can shed some light on the free strict $\omega$-category monad on globular sets and the free operad-with-contraction monad on the category of collections.

Title: Quotient models of a category up to directed homotopy
Authors: Marco Grandis
Abstract: Directed Algebraic Topology is a recent field, deeply linked with ordinary and higher dimensional Category Theory. A `directed space', e.g. an ordered topological space, has directed homotopies (which are generally non reversible) and a fundamental <i>category</i> (replacing the fundamental groupoid of the classical case). Finding a simple - possibly finite - model of the latter is a non-trivial problem, whose solution gives relevant information on the given `space'; a problem which is of interest for applications as well as in general Category Theory. Here we continue the work ``The shape of a category up to directed homotopy", with a deeper analysis of `surjective models', motivated by studying the singularities of 3-dimensional ordered spaces.

Title: Categories of components and loop-free categories
Authors: Emmanuel Haucourt
Abstract: Given a groupoid G one has, in addition to the equivalence of categories E from G to its skeleton, a fibration F from G to its set of connected components (seen as a discrete category). From the observation that E and F differ unless G[x,x]=id_x for every object x of G, we prove there is a fibered equivalence from C[\Sigma^{-1}] to C/\Sigma when \Sigma is a <i>Yoneda</i>-system of a loop-free category C. In fact, all the equivalences from C[\Sigma^{-1}]$ to C/\Sigma are fibered. Furthermore, since the quotient C/\Sigma shrinks as \Sigma grows, we define the component category of a loop-free category as C/{\overline{\Sigma}} where \overline{\Sigma} is the greatest <i>Yoneda</i>-system of C.

Title: Categorified Algebra and Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Jeffrey Morton
Abstract: The process some call `categorification' consists of interpreting set-theoretic structures in mathematics as derived from category-theoretic structures. Examples include the interpretation of N as the Burnside rig of the category of finite sets with product and coproduct, and of N[x] in terms the category of combinatorial species. This has interesting applications to quantum mechanics, and in particular the quantum harmonic oscillator, via Joyal's `combinatorial species', and a new generalization called `stuff types' described by Baez and Dolan, which are a special case of Kelly's `clubs'. Operators between stuff types be represented as rudimentary Feynman diagrams for the oscillator. In quantum mechanics, we want to represent states in an algebra over the complex numbers, and also want our Feynman diagrams to carry more structure than these `stuff operators' can do, and these turn out to be closely related. We will describe a categorification of the quantum harmonic oscillator in which the group of `phases' - that is, U(1), the circle group - plays a special role. We describe a general notion of `M-stuff types' for any monoid M, and see that the case M = U(1) provides an interpretation of time evolution in the combinatorial setting, as well as recovering the usual Feynman rules for the quantum harmonic oscillator.

Title: A cohomological description of connections and curvature over posets
Authors: John E. Roberts, Giuseppe Ruzzi
Abstract: What remains of a geometrical notion like that of a principal bundle when the base space is not a manifold but a coarse graining of it, like the poset formed by a base for the topology ordered under inclusion? Motivated by the search for a geometrical framework for developing gauge theories in algebraic quantum field theory, we give, in the present paper, a first answer to this question. The notions of transition function, connection form and curvature form find a nice description in terms of cohomology, in general non-Abelian, of a poset with values in a group G. Interpreting a 1-cocycle as a principal bundle, a connection turns out to be a 1-cochain associated in a suitable way with this 1-cocycle; the curvature of a connection turns out to be its 2-coboundary. We show the existence of nonflat connections, and relate flat connections to homomorphisms of the fundamental group of the poset into G. We discuss holonomy and prove an analogue of the Ambrose-Singer theorem.

Title: Generating families in a topos
Authors: Toby Kenney
Abstract: A <i> generating family,</i> in a category C is a collection of objects $\{A_i|i\in I\}$ such that if for any subobject Y >--> X, every $f: A_i \rightarrow X$ factors through m, then m is an isomorphism - i.e. the functors $C(A_i, - )$ are collectively conservative. In this paper, we examine some circumstances under which subobjects of 1 form a generating family. Objects for which subobjects of 1 do form a generating family are called <i>partially well-pointed</i>. For a Grothendieck topos, it is well known that subobjects of 1 form a generating family if and only if the topos is localic. For the elementary case, little more is known. The problem is studied by Borceux, where it is shown that the result is internally true, an equivalent condition is found in the boolean case, and certain preservation properties are shown. We look at two different approaches to the problem, one based on a generalization of projectivity, and the other based on looking at the most extreme sorts of counterexamples.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine a new approach to topos theory - rather than considering subobjects, look at quotients. This leads to the notion of a copower object, which is the object of quotients of a given object. We study some properties of copower objects, many of which are similar to the properties of power objects. Given enough categorical structure (i.e. in a pretopos) it is possible to get power objects from copower objects, and vice versa.

Authors: Valeria de Paiva, Eike Ritter
Abstract: This paper describes a natural deduction formulation for Full Intuitionistic Linear Logic (FILL), an intriguing variation of multiplicative linear logic, due to Hyland and de Paiva. The system FILL resembles intuitionistic logic, in that all its connectives are independent, but resembles classical logic in that its sequent-calculus formulation has intrinsic multiple conclusions. From the intrinsic multiple conclusions comes the inspiration to modify Parigot's natural deduction systems for classical logic, to produce a natural deduction formulation and a term assignment system for FILL.

Title: The Dialectica interpretation of first-order classical affine logic
Authors: Masaru Shirahata
Abstract: We give a Dialectica-style interpretation of first-order classical affine logic. By moving to a contraction-free logic, the translation (a.k.a. D-translation) of a first-order formula into a higher-type $\exists\forall$-formula can be made symmetric with respect to duality, including exponentials. It turned out that the propositional part of our D-translation uses the same construction as de Paiva's dialectica category GC and we show how our D-translation extends GC to the first-order setting in terms of an indexed category. Furthermore the combination of Girard's ?!-translation and our D-translation results in the essentially equivalent $\exists\forall$-formulas as the double-negation translation and Godel's original D-translation.

Title: Approximable Concepts, Chu spaces, and information systems
Authors: Guo-Qiang Zhang, Gongqin Shen
Abstract: This paper serves to bring three independent but important areas of computer science to a common meeting point: Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), Chu Spaces, and Domain Theory (DT). Each area is given a perspective or reformulation that is conducive to the flow of ideas and to the exploration of cross-disciplinary connections. Among other results, we show that the notion of state in Scott's information system corresponds precisely to that of formal concepts in FCA with respect to all finite Chu spaces, and the entailment relation corresponds to ``association rules". We introduce, moreover, the notion of <i>approximable concept</i> and show that approximable concepts represent algebraic lattices which are identical to Scott domains except the inclusion of a top element. This notion serves as a stepping stone in recent work in which a new notion of morphism on formal contexts results in a category equivalent to (a) the category of complete algebraic lattices and Scott continuous functions, and (b) a category of information systems and approximable mappings.

Title: An extended view of the Chu-construction
Authors: Jurgen Koslowski
Abstract: The cyclic Chu-construction for closed bicategories with pullbacks, which generalizes the original Chu-construction for symmetric monoidal closed categories, turns out to have a non-cyclic counterpart. Both use so-called Chu-spans as new 1-cells between 1-cells of the underlying bicategory, which form the new objects. Chu-spans may be seen as a natural generalization of 2-cell-spans in the base bicategory that no longer are confined to a single hom-category. This view helps to clarify the composition of Chu-spans. <p> We consider various approaches of linking the underlying bicategory with the newly constructed ones, e.g. by means of two-dimensional generalizations of bifibrations. In the quest for a better connection, we investigate, whether Chu-spans form a double category. While this turns out not to be the case, we are led to considering a generalization of the construction to paths of 1-cells in the base, leading to two hierarchies of closed bicategories, one for linear paths and one for loops. The possibility of moving beyond paths, respectively, loops of the same length is indicated. <p> Finally, Chu-spans in <i>rel</i> are identified as bipartite state transition systems. Even though their composition may fail here due to the lack of pullbacks in <i>rel</i>, basic game-theoretic constructions can be performed on cyclic Chu-spans. These are available in all symmetric monoidal closed categories with finite products. If pullbacks exist as well, the bicategory of cyclic Chu-spans inherits a monoidal structure that on objects coincides with the categorical product.

Title: Dialectica and Chu Constructions: Cousins?
Authors: Valeria de Paiva
Abstract: This note investigates two generic constructions used to produce categorical models of linear logic, the Chu construction and the Dialectica construction, in parallel. The constructions have the same objects, but are rather different in other ways. We discuss similarities and differences and prove that the Dialectica construction can be done over a symmetric monoidal closed basis. We also point out interesting open problems concerning the Dialectica construction.

Title: Polarized category theory, modules, and game semantics
Authors: J. R. B. Cockett, R. A. G. Seely
Abstract: Motivated by an analysis of Abramsky-Jagadeesan games, the paper considers a categorical semantics for a polarized notion of two-player games, a semantics which has close connections with the logic of (finite cartesian) sums and products, as well as with the multiplicative structure of linear logic. In each case, the structure is polarized, in the sense that it will be modelled by two categories, one for each of two polarities, with a module structure connecting them. These are studied in considerable detail, and a comparison is made with a different notion of polarization due to Olivier Laurent: there is an adjoint connection between the two notions.

Abstract: It is the aim of this paper to compute the category of Eilenberg-Moore algebras for the monad arising from the dual unit-ball functor on the category of (semi)normed spaces.

Title: On Yetter's Invariant and an Extension of the Dijkgraaf-Witten Invariant to Categorical Groups
Authors: Joao Faria Martins, Timothy Porter
Abstract: We give an interpretation of Yetter's Invariant of manifolds <i>M</i> in terms of the homotopy type of the function space TOP(<i>M,B(\cal G)</i>)$, where <i>\cal G</i> is a crossed module and <i>B(\cal G)</i> is its classifying space. From this formulation, there follows that Yetter's invariant depends only on the homotopy type of <i>M</i>, and the weak homotopy type of the crossed module <i>\cal G</i>. We use this interpretation to define a twisting of Yetter's Invariant by cohomology classes of crossed modules, defined as cohomology classes of their classifying spaces, in the form of a state sum invariant. In particular, we obtain an extension of the Dijkgraaf-Witten Invariant of manifolds to categorical groups. The straightforward extension to crossed complexes is also considered.

Abstract: Francisco Marmolejo pointed out a mistake in the statement of Proposition 4.4 in our TAC paper (Vol. 16, No. 28). The mistaken version is used later in that paper.

The description uses the distinguished morphisms of a factorization system on the category of G-sets.

Title: Quasi locally connected toposes
Authors: Marta Bunge, Jonathon Funk
Abstract: We have shown that complete spreads (with a locally connected domain) over a bounded topos <b>E</b> (relative to <b>S</b>) are `comprehensive' in the sense that they are precisely the second factor of a factorization associated with an instance of the comprehension scheme involving <b>S</b>-valued distributions on <b>E</b>. Lawvere has asked whether the `Michael coverings' (or complete spreads with a definable dominance domain) are comprehensive in a similar fashion. We give here a positive answer to this question. In order to deal effectively with the comprehension scheme in this context, we introduce a notion of an `extensive topos doctrine,' where the extensive quantities (or distributions) have values in a suitable subcategory of what we call `locally discrete' locales. In the process we define what we mean by a quasi locally connected topos, a notion that we feel may be of interest in its own right.

Title: Towards an $n$-category of cobordisms
Authors: Eugenia Cheng, Nick Gurski
Abstract: We discuss an approach to constructing a weak n-category of cobordisms. First we present a generalisation of Trimble's definition of n-category which seems most appropriate for this construction; in this definition composition is parametrised by a contractible operad. Then we show how to use this definition to define the n-category <b>nCob</b>, whose k-cells are k-cobordisms, possibly with corners. We follow Baez and Langford in using ``manifolds embedded in cubes'' rather than general manifolds. We make the construction for 1-manifolds embedded in 2- and 3-cubes. For general dimensions k and n we indicate what the construction should be.

Title: The theory of core algebras: its completeness
Authors: Peter Freyd
Abstract: The core of a category (first defined in ``Core algebra revisited'' <i>Theoretical Computer Science</i>, Vol 375, Issues 1-3, pp 193-200) has the structure of an abstract core algebra (first defined in the same place). A question was left open: is there more structure yet to be defined? The answer is no: it is shown that any operation on an object arising from the fact that the object is the core of its category can be defined using only the constant and two binary operations that appear in the definition of abstract core algebra. In the process a number of facts about abstract core algebras must be developed.

Title: Higher cospans and weak cubical categories (Cospans in algebraic topology, I)
Authors: Marco Grandis
Abstract: We define a notion of <i> weak cubical category</i>, abstracted from the structure of n-cubical cospans $x : \wedge^n \to X$ in a category $X$ where $\wedge$ is the `formal cospan' category. These diagrams form a cubical set with compositions $x +_i y$ in all directions, which are computed using pushouts and behave `categorically' in a weak sense, up to suitable comparisons. Actually, we work with a `symmetric cubical structure', which includes the transposition symmetries, because this allows for a strong simplification of the coherence conditions. These notions will be used in subsequent papers to study topological cospans and their use in Algebraic Topology, from tangles to cobordisms of manifolds.

Title: Coherent unit actions on regular operads and Hopf algebras
Authors: Kurusch Ebrahimi-Fard, Li Guo
Abstract: J.-L. Loday introduced the concept of coherent unit actions on a regular operad and showed that such actions give Hopf algebra structures on the free algebras. Hopf algebras obtained this way include the Hopf algebras of shuffles, quasi-shuffles and planar rooted trees. We characterize coherent unit actions on binary quadratic regular operads in terms of linear equations of the generators of the operads. We then use these equations to classify operads with coherent unit actions. We further show that coherent unit actions are preserved under taking products and thus yield Hopf algebras on the free object of the product operads when the factor operads have coherent unit actions. On the other hand, coherent unit actions are never preserved under taking the dual in the operadic sense except for the operad of associative algebras.

Authors: Panagis Karazeris, Jiri Velebil
Abstract: Given an arbitrary locally finitely presentable category $K$ and finitary monads $T$ and $S$ on $K$, we characterize monad morphisms $\alpha: S\to T$ with the property that the induced functor $\alpha_*: K^T \to K^ S$ between the categories of Eilenberg-Moore algebras is fully faithful. We call such monad morphisms dense and give a characterization of them in the spirit of Beth's definability theorem: $\alpha$ is a dense monad morphism if and only if every $T$-operation is explicitly defined using $S$-operations. We also give a characterization in terms of epimorphic property of $\alpha$ and clarify the connection between various notions of epimorphisms between monads.

So to any object $X$ in $\cal M$ one can attach an endomorphism ring object, denoted $hEnd_ad(X)$, in the category $Sp^\Sigma(sAb)$. We establish some useful properties of these endomorphism rings.

Abstract: The Medial rule was first devised as a deduction rule in the Calculus of Structures. In this paper we explore it from the point of view of category theory, as additional structure on a *-autonomous category. This gives us some insights on the denotational semantics of classical propositional logic, and allows us to construct new models for it, based on suitable generalizations of the theory of coherence spaces.

Title: On the axiomatisation of Boolean categories with and without medial
Authors: Lutz Strassburger
Abstract: The term ``Boolean category'' should be used for describing an object that is to categories what a Boolean algebra is to posets. More specifically, a Boolean category should provide the abstract algebraic structure underlying the proofs in Boolean Logic, in the same sense as a Cartesian closed category captures the proofs in intuitionistic logic and a *-autonomous category captures the proofs in linear logic. However, recent work has shown that there is no canonical axiomatisation of a Boolean category. In this work, we will see a series (with increasing strength) of possible such axiomatisations, all based on the notion of *-autonomous category. We will particularly focus on the medial map, which has its origin in an inference rule in KS, a cut-free deductive system for Boolean logic in the calculus of structures. Finally, we will present a category of proof nets as a particularly well-behaved example of a Boolean category.

Title: Familial 2-functors and parametric right adjoints
Authors: Mark Weber
Abstract: We define and study familial 2-functors primarily with a view to the development of the 2-categorical approach to operads of [Weber, 2005]. Also included in this paper is a result in which the well-known characterisation of a category as a simplicial set via the Segal condition, is generalised to a result about nice monads on cocomplete categories. Instances of this general result can be found in [Leinster, 2004], [Berger, 2002] and [Moerdijk-Weiss, 2007b]. Aspects of this general theory are then used to show that the composite 2-monads of [Weber, 2005] that describe symmetric and braided analogues of the $\omega$-operads of [Batanin, 1998], are cartesian 2-monads and their underlying endo-2-functor is familial. Intricately linked to the notion of familial 2-functor is the theory of fibrations in a finitely complete 2-category [Street, 1974] [Street, 1980], and those aspects of that theory that we require, that weren't discussed in [Weber, 2007], are reviewed here.

Some consequences and applications are presented.

Title: Axiomatic Cohesion
Authors: F. William Lawvere
Abstract: The nature of the spatial background for classical analysis and for modern theories of continuum physics requires more than the partial invariants of locales and cohomology rings for its description. As Maxwell emphasized, this description has various levels of precision depending on the needs of investigation. These levels correspond to different categories of space, all of which have intuitively the feature of cohesion. Our aim here is to continue the axiomatic study of such categories, which involves the following aspects:<br> I. Categories of space as cohesive backgrounds<br> II. Cohesion versus non-cohesion; quality types<br> III. Extensive quality; intensive quality in its rarefied and condensed aspects; the canonical qualities form and substance<br> IV. Non-cohesion within cohesion via constancy on infinitesimals<br> V. The example of reflexive graphs and their atomic numbers<br> VI. Sufficient cohesion and the Grothendieck condition<br> VII. Weak generation of a subtopos by a quotient topos<br> I look forward to further work on each of these aspects, as well as development of categories of dynamical laws, constitutive relations, and other mathematical structures that naturally live in cohesive categories.

Title: Abelian groupoids and non-pointed additive categories
Authors: Dominique Bourn
Abstract: We show that, in any Mal'tsev (and a fortiori protomodular) category <b>E</b>, not only the fibre <i>Grd</i>_X <b>E</b> of internal groupoids above the object <i>X</i> is a naturally Mal'tsev category, but moreover it shares with the category <i>Ab</i> of abelian groups the property following which the domain of any split epimorphism is isomorphic with the direct sum of its codomain with its kernel. This allows us to point at a new class of ``non-pointed additive'' categories which is necessarily protomodular. Actually this even gives rise to a larger classification table of non-pointed additive categories which gradually take place between the class of naturally Mal'tsev categories and the one of essentially affine categories. As an application, when furthermore the ground category <b>E</b> is efficiently regular, we get a new way to produce Baer sums in the fibres <i>Grd</i>_X <b>E</b> and, more generally, in the fibres <i>n-Grd</i>_X <b>E</b>.

Title: Balanced category theory
Authors: Claudio Pisani
Abstract: Some aspects of basic category theory are developed in a finitely complete category $\cal C$, endowed with two factorization systems which determine the same discrete objects and are linked by a simple reciprocal stability law. Resting on this axiomatization of final and initial functors and discrete (op)fibrations, concepts such as components, slices and coslices, colimits and limits, left and right adjunctible maps, dense maps and arrow intervals, can be naturally defined in $\cal C$, and several classical properties concerning them can be effectively proved. For any object $X$ of $\cal C$, by restricting $\cal C/X$ to the slices or to the coslices of $X$, two dual ``underlying categories" are obtained. These can be enriched over internal sets (discrete objects) of $\cal C$: internal hom-sets are given by the components of the pullback of the corresponding slice and coslice of $X$. The construction extends to give functors $\cal C \to Cat$, which preserve (or reverse) slices and adjunctible maps and which can be enriched over internal sets too.

Authors: Lars Birkedal, Rasmus E. Mogelberg, Rasmus L. Petersen
Abstract: This paper presents a sound and complete category-theoretic notion of models for Linear Abadi and Plotkin Logic, a logic suitable for reasoning about parametricity in combination with recursion. A subclass of these called <i>parametric LAPL structures</i> can be seen as an axiomatization of domain theoretic models of parametric polymorphism, and we show how to solve general (nested) recursive domain equations in these. Parametric LAPL structures constitute a general notion of model of parametricity in a setting with recursion. In future papers we will demonstrate this by showing how many different models of parametricity and recursion give rise to parametric LAPL structures, including Simpson and Rosolini's set theoretic models, a syntactic model based on Lily and a model based on admissible pers over a reflexive domain.

Title: Kan extensions in double categories
Authors: Marco Grandis, Robert Par&eacute;
Abstract: This paper deals with Kan extensions in a weak double category. <i> Absolute</i> Kan extensions are closely related to the orthogonal adjunctions introduced in a previous paper. The <i>pointwise</i> case is treated by introducing internal comma objects, which can be defined in an arbitrary double category.

Title: Fundamental pushout toposes
Authors: Marta Bunge
Abstract: The author introduced and employed certain `fundamental pushout toposes' in the construction of the coverings fundamental groupoid of a locally connected topos. Our main purpose in this paper is to generalize this construction without the local connectedness assumption. We replace connected components by constructively complemented, or definable, monomorphisms. Unlike the locally connected case, where the fundamental groupoid is localic prodiscrete and its classifying topos is a Galois topos, in the general case our version of the fundamental groupoid is a locally discrete progroupoid and there is no intrinsic Galois theory in the sense of Janelidze. We also discuss covering projections, locally trivial, and branched coverings without local connectedness by analogy with, but also necessarily departing from, the locally connected case. Throughout, we work abstractly in a setting given axiomatically by a category <b>V</b> of locally discrete locales that has as examples the categories <b>D</b> of discrete locales, and <b>Z</b> of zero-dimensional locales. In this fashion we are led to give unified and often simpler proofs of old theorems in the locally connected case, as well as new ones without that assumption.

Abstract: We construct a star-autonomous structure on the functor category $K^J$, where $J$ is small, $K$ is small-complete, and both are star-autonomous. A weaker result, that $K^J$ admits a linear distributive structure, is also shown under weaker hypotheses. The latter leads to a deeper understanding of the notion of linear functor.

Title: Colimits of representable algebra-valued functors
Authors: George M. Bergman
Abstract: If C and D are varieties of algebras in the sense of general algebra, then by a representable functor C --> D we understand a functor which, when composed with the forgetful functor D --> Set, gives a representable functor in the classical sense; Freyd showed that these functors are determined by D-coalgebra objects of C. Let Rep(C, D) denote the category of all such functors, a full subcategory of Cat(C, D, opposite to the category of D-coalgebras in C.

Title: Quotients of unital $A_\infty$-categories
Authors: Volodymyr Lyubashenko, Oleksandr Manzyuk
Abstract: Assuming that $B$ is a full $A_\infty$-subcategory of a unital $A_\infty$-category $\cc$ we construct the quotient unital $A_\infty$-category $\cd=$`$\cc/\cb$'. It represents the $A_\infty^u$-2-functor $A \mapsto A_\infty^u(C,A)_{mod B}$, which associates with a given unital $A_\infty$-category $A$ the $A_\infty$-category of unital $A_\infty$-functors $C \to A$, whose restriction to $B$ is contractible. Namely, there is a unital $A_\infty$-functor $e: C \to D$ such that the composition $B \hookrightarrow C \to^e D$ is contractible, and for an arbitrary unital $A_\infty$-category $A$ the restriction $A_\infty$-functor $(e\boxtimes 1)M : A_\infty^u(D,A)\to A_\infty^u(C,A)_{mod B}$ is an equivalence.

Title: Core varieties, extensivity, and rig geometry
Authors: F. William Lawvere
Abstract: The role of the Frobenius operations in analyzing finite spaces, as well as the extended algebraic geometry over rigs, depend partly on varieties (Birkhoffian inclusions of algebraic categories) that have coreflections as well as reflections and whose dual category of affine spaces is extensive. Even within the category of those rigs where 1 + 1 = 1, not only distributive lattices but also the function algebras of tropical geometry (where x + 1 = 1) and the dimension rigs of separable prextensive categories (where x + x^2 = x^2) enjoy those features.

Title: Cohomology theory in 2-categories
Authors: Hiroyuki Nakaoka
Abstract: Recently, symmetric categorical groups are used for the study of the Brauer groups of symmetric monoidal categories. As a part of these efforts, some algebraic structures of the 2-category of symmetric categorical groups SCG are being investigated. In this paper, we consider a 2-categorical analogue of an abelian category, in such a way that it contains SCG as an example. As a main theorem, we construct a long cohomology 2-exact sequence from any extension of complexes in such a 2-category. Our axiomatic and self-dual definition will enable us to simplify the proofs, by analogy with abelian categories.

Title: Framed bicategories and monoidal fibrations
Authors: Michael Shulman
Abstract: In some bicategories, the 1-cells are `morphisms' between the 0-cells, such as functors between categories, but in others they are `objects' over the 0-cells, such as bimodules, spans, distributors, or parametrized spectra. Many bicategorical notions do not work well in these cases, because the `morphisms between 0-cells', such as ring homomorphisms, are missing. We can include them by using a pseudo double category, but usually these morphisms also induce base change functors acting on the 1-cells. We avoid complicated coherence problems by describing base change `nonalgebraically', using categorical fibrations. The resulting `framed bicategories' assemble into 2-categories, with attendant notions of equivalence, adjunction, and so on which are more appropriate for our examples than are the usual bicategorical ones.

The number of unary operations can be restricted to |mor <i>k</i>| in case when <i>k</i> has a terminal object and only preservation of limits over finitely many objects is desired. And all limits existing in such a category <i>k</i> are preserved by a full embedding of <i>k</i> into the category of all algebraic systems with |mor <i>k</i>| unary operation and one unary relation.

Title: Doubles for monoidal categories
Authors: Craig Pastro, Ross Street
Abstract: In a recent paper, Daisuke Tambara defined two-sided actions on an endomodule (= endodistributor) of a monoidal <i>V</i>-category <i>A</i>. When <i>A</i> is autonomous (= rigid = compact), he showed that the <i>V</i>-category (that we call Tamb(<i>A</i>)) of so-equipped endomodules (that we call Tambara modules) is equivalent to the monoidal centre <i>Z</i>[<i>A,V</i>] of the convolution monoidal <i>V</i>-category [<i>A, V</i>]. Our paper extends these ideas somewhat. For general <i>A</i>, we construct a promonoidal <i>V</i>-category <i>DA</i> (which we suggest should be called the double of <i>A</i>) with an equivalence of [<i>DA, V</i>] with Tamb(<i>A</i>). When <i>A</i> is closed, we define strong (respectively, left strong) Tambara modules and show that these constitute a <i>V</i>-category Tamb_s(<i>A</i>) (respectively, Tamb_{ls}(<i>A</i>)) which is equivalent to the centre (respectively, lax centre) of [<i>A, V</i>]. We construct localizations <i>D_sA</i> and <i>D_{ls}A</i> of <i>DA</i> such that there are equivalences of Tamb_s(<i>A</i>) with [<i>D_sA, V</i>] and of Tamb_{ls}(<i>A</i>) with [<i>D_{ls}A, V</i>]. When <i>A</i> is autonomous, every Tambara module is strong; this implies an equivalence of <i>Z</i>[<i>A, V</i>] with [<i>DA,V</i>].

We also give a simplified characterization of internal groupoids among internal categories in this context.

Title: Extensions in the theory of lax algebras
Authors: Christoph Schubert, Gavin J. Seal
Abstract: Recent investigations of lax algebras - in generalization of Barr's relational algebras -make an essential use of lax extensions of monad functors on Set to the category Rel(V) of sets and V-relations (where V is a unital quantale). For a given monad there may be many such lax extensions, and different constructions appear in the literature. The aim of this article is to shed a unifying light on these lax extensions, and present a symptomatic situation in which distinct monads yield isomorphic categories of lax algebras.

Title: Approximate Mal'tsev operations
Authors: Dominique Bourn, Zurab Janelidze
Abstract: Let $X$ and $A$ be sets and $\alpha:X\to A$ a map between them. We call a map $\mu:X\times X\times X\to A$ an <i>approximate Mal'tsev operation with approximation $\alpha$</i>, if it satisfies $\mu(x,y,y) = \alpha(x) = \mu(y,y,x)$ for all $x,y\in X$. Note that if $A = X$ and the approximation $\alpha$ is an identity map, then $\mu$ becomes an ordinary Mal'tsev operation. We prove the following two characterization theorems: a category $\mathbb{X}$ is a Mal'tsev category if and only if in the functor category $\mathbf{Set}^{\mathbb{X}^\mathrm{op}\times\mathbb{X}}$ there exists an internal approximate Mal'tsev operation $\mathrm{hom}_{\mathbb{X}}\times \mathrm{hom}_{\mathbb{X}}\times \mathrm{hom}_{\mathbb{X}}\rightarrow A$ whose approximation $\alpha$ satisfies a suitable condition; a regular category $\mathbb{X}$ with finite coproducts is a Mal'tsev category, if and only if in the functor category $\mathbb{X}^\mathbb{X}$ there exists an internal approximate Mal'tsev co-operation $A\rightarrow 1_\mathbb{X}+1_\mathbb{X}+1_\mathbb{X}$ whose approximation $\alpha$ is a natural transformation with every component a regular epimorphism in $\mathbb{X}$. Note that in both of these characterization theorems, if require further the approximation $\alpha$ to be an identity morphism, then the conditions there involving $\alpha$ become equivalent to $\mathbb{X}$ being a naturally Mal'tsev category.

Title: Analytic functors and weak pullbacks
Authors: J. Adamek, J. Velebil
Abstract: For accessible set-valued functors it is well known that weak preservation of limits is equivalent to representability, and weak preservation of connected limits to familial representability. In contrast, preservation of weak wide pullbacks is equivalent to being a coproduct of quotients of $\hom$-functors modulo groups of automorphisms. For finitary functors this was proved by Andr\'e Joyal who called these functors analytic. We introduce a generalization of Joyal's concept from endofunctors of <b>Set</b> to endofunctors of a symmetric monoidal category.

Title: Relative injectivity as cocompleteness for a class of distributors
Authors: Maria Manuel Clementino, Dirk Hofmann
Abstract: Notions and techniques of enriched category theory can be used to study topological structures, like metric spaces, topological spaces and approach spaces, in the context of topological theories. Recently in [D. Hofmann, Injective spaces via adjunction, arXiv:math.CT/0804.0326] the construction of a Yoneda embedding allowed to identify injectivity of spaces as cocompleteness and to show monadicity of the category of injective spaces and left adjoints over SET. In this paper we generalise these results, studying cocompleteness with respect to a given class of distributors. We show in particular that the description of several semantic domains presented in [M. Escardo and B. Flagg, Semantic domains, injective spaces and monads, Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 20 (1999)] can be translated into the V-enriched setting.

Title: Searching for more absolute CR-epic spaces
Authors: Michael Barr, John F. Kennison, R. Raphael
Abstract: We continue our examination of absolute CR-epic spaces, or spaces with the property that any embedding induces an epimorphism, in the category of commutative rings, between their rings of continuous functions. We examine more closely the deleted plank construction, which generalizes the Dieudonne construction, and yields absolute CR-epic spaces which are not Lindelof. For the Lindelof case, an earlier paper has shown the usefulness of the countable neighbourhood property, CNP, and the Alster condition (where CNP means that the space is a P-space in any compactification and the Alster condition says that any cover of the space by $G_\delta$ sets has a countable subcover, provided each compact subset can be covered by a finite subset.) In this paper, we find further properties of Lindelof CNP spaces and of Alster spaces, including constructions that preserve these properties and conditions equivalent to these properties. We explore the outgrowths of such spaces and find several examples that answer open questions in our previous work.

Abstract: Prior work towards the subject of higher-dimensional categories gives rise to several examples of a category over $Cat$ to which the slice-category construction can be lifted universally. The present paper starts by supplying this last clause with a precise meaning. It goes on to establish for any such category a certain embedding in a presheaf category, to describe the image, and hence to derive conditions collectively sufficient for that functor to be an equivalence. These conditions are met in the foremost of the examples: the category of dendrotopic sets.

Abstract: In a triangulated closed symmetric monoidal category, there are natural dualities induced by the internal Hom. Given a monoidal exact functor $f^*$ between two such categories and adjoint couples $(f^*,f_*)$, $(f_*,f^!)$, we establish the commutative diagrams necessary for $f^*$ and $f_*$ to respect certain dualities, for a projection formula to hold between them (as duality preserving exact functors) and for classical base change and composition formulas to hold when such duality preserving functors are composed. This framework allows us to define push-forwards for Witt groups, for example.

Title: Lois distributives. Applications aux automates stochastiques
Authors: Elisabeth Burroni
Abstract: Deterministic automata are algebras of the monad $T_M$ associated to a free monoid $M$. To extend to nondeterministic and stochastic automata such a monadic formalism, it is suitable to resort to a notion richer than the one of monad, but equally basic: the notion of distributive law between two monads. The notion of algebra on a monad is then generalized by the one of algebra for a distributive law. The nondeterministic and stochastic automata are precisely algebras for distributive laws whose first monad is $T_M$. If the nondeterministic case involves a distributive law between $T_M$ and the well-known power set monad, the stochastic case involves a distributive law between $T_M$ (where, here, $M$ is a measurable monoid) and the probability monad. This allows presentation of the stochastic automata as algebras for this distributive law. This paper taking place at the confluence of category, automata and probability theories, we have, for the convenience of the reader not aware of each area, made useful reviews about these subjects (in several appendices). We also recall the detailed construction of the probability monad; and we construct precisely the distributive law which links it to the monad $T_M$.

Title: Algebraic colimit calculations in homotopy theory using fibred and cofibred categories
Authors: Ronald Brown, Rafael Sivera
Abstract: Higher Homotopy van Kampen Theorems allow some colimit calculations of certain homotopical invariants of glued spaces. One corollary is to describe homotopical excision in critical dimensions in terms of induced modules and crossed modules over groupoids. This paper shows how fibred and cofibred categories give an overall context for discussing and computing such constructions, allowing one result to cover many cases. A useful general result is that the inclusion of a fibre of a fibred category preserves connected colimits. The main homotopical applications are to pairs of spaces with several base points; we also describe briefly applications to triads.

Title: Covering space theory for directed topology
Authors: Eric Goubault, Emmanuel Haucourt, Sanjeevi Krishnan
Abstract: The state space of a machine admits the structure of time. For example, the geometric realization of a precubical set, a generalization of an unlabeled asynchronous transition system, admits a ``local preorder'' encoding control flow. In the case where time does not loop, the ``locally preordered'' state space splits into causally distinct components. The set of such components often gives a computable invariant of machine behavior. In the general case, no such meaningful partition could exist. However, as we show in this note, the locally preordered geometric realization of a precubical set admits a ``locally monotone'' covering from a state space in which time does not loop. Thus we hope to extend geometric techniques in static program analysis to looping processes.

Title: On the categorical semantics of elementary linear logic
Authors: Olivier Laurent
Abstract: We introduce the notion of <i>elementary Seely category</i> as a notion of categorical model of Elementary Linear Logic (ELL) inspired from Seely's definition of models of Linear Logic (LL). In order to deal with additive connectives in ELL, we use the approach of Danos and Joinet. From the categorical point of view, this requires us to go outside the usual interpretation of connectives by functors. The $!$ connective is decomposed into a pre-connective $\sharp$ which is interpreted by a whole family of functors (generated by $\id$, $\tens$ and $\with$). As an application, we prove the stratified coherent model and the obsessional coherent model to be elementary Seely categories and thus models of ELL.

Title: Enriched Orthogonality and Equivalences
Authors: M. Golasinski, L. Stramaccia
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an enriched orthogonality for classes of spaces, with respect to groupoids, simplicial sets and spaces themselves. This point of view allows one to characterize homotopy equivalences, shape and strong shape equivalences. We show that there exists a class of spaces, properly containing ANR-spaces, for which shape and strong shape equivalences coincide. For such a class of spaces homotopy orthogonality implies enriched orthogonality.

Title: Weak distributive laws
Authors: Ross Street
Abstract: Distributive laws between monads (triples) were defined by Jon Beck in the 1960s. They were generalized to monads in 2-categories and noticed to be monads in a 2-category of monads. Mixed distributive laws are comonads in the 2-category of monads; if the comonad has a right adjoint monad, the mate of a mixed distributive law is an ordinary distributive law. Particular cases are the entwining operators between algebras and coalgebras. Motivated by work on weak entwining operators, we define and study a weak notion of distributive law for monads. In particular, each weak distributive law determines a wreath product monad (in the terminology of Lack and Street); this gives an advantage over the mixed case.

Title: An embedding theorem for Hilbert categories
Authors: Chris Heunen
Abstract: We axiomatically define (pre-)Hilbert categories. The axioms resemble those for monoidal Abelian categories with the addition of an involutive functor. We then prove embedding theorems: any locally small pre-Hilbert category whose monoidal unit is a simple generator embeds (weakly) monoidally into the category of pre-Hilbert spaces and adjointable maps, preserving adjoint morphisms and all finite (co)limits. An intermediate result that is important in its own right is that the scalars in such a category necessarily form an involutive field. In case of a Hilbert category, the embedding extends to the category of Hilbert spaces and continuous linear maps. The axioms for (pre-)Hilbert categories are weaker than the axioms found in other approaches to axiomatizing 2-Hilbert spaces. Neither enrichment nor a complex base field is presupposed. A comparison to other approaches will be made in the introduction.

Title: Eventually cyclic spectra of parameterized flows
Authors: John F. Kennison
Abstract: This paper continues the work of our previous papers, <i>The cyclic spectrum of a Boolean flow</i> TAC 10, 392-419 and <i>Spectra of finitely generated Boolean flows</i> TAC 16, 434-459. We define eventually cyclic Boolean flows and the eventually cyclic spectrum of a Boolean flow. We show that this spectrum, as well as the spectra defined in our earlier papers, extend to parametrized flows on Stone spaces and on compact Hausdorff space when symbolic dynamics is used. An example shows that the cyclic spectrum for a parameterized flow is sometimes over a non-spatial locale.

Title: Epimorphic covers make $R^+_G$ a site, for profinite $G$
Authors: Daniel G. Davis
Abstract: Let $G$ be a non-finite profinite group and let $G-Sets_{df}$ be the canonical site of finite discrete $G$-sets. Then the category $R^+_G$, defined by Devinatz and Hopkins, is the category obtained by considering $G-Sets_{df}$ together with the profinite $G$-space $G$ itself, with morphisms being continuous $G$-equivariant maps. We show that $R^+_G$ is a site when equipped with the pretopology of epimorphic covers. We point out that presheaves of spectra on $R^+_G$ are an efficient way of organizing the data that is obtained by taking the homotopy fixed points of a continuous $G$-spectrum with respect to the open subgroups of $G$. Additionally, utilizing the result that $R^+_G$ is a site, we describe various model category structures on the category of presheaves of spectra on $R^+_G$ and make some observations about them.

Title: Higher-dimensional categories with finite derivation type
Authors: Yves Guiraud, Philippe Malbos
Abstract: We study convergent (terminating and confluent) presentations of n-categories. Using the notion of polygraph (or computad), we introduce the homotopical property of finite derivation type for n-categories, generalising the one introduced by Squier for word rewriting systems. We characterise this property by using the notion of critical branching. In particular, we define sufficient conditions for an n-category to have finite derivation type. Through examples, we present several techniques based on derivations of 2-categories to study convergent presentations by 3-polygraphs.

Title: A brief review of abelian categorifications
Authors: Mikhail Khovanov, Volodymyr Mazorchuk, Catharina Stroppel
Abstract: This article contains a review of categorifications of semisimple representations of various rings via abelian categories and exact endofunctors on them. A simple definition of an abelian categorification is presented and illustrated with several examples, including categorifications of various representations of the symmetric group and its Hecke algebra via highest weight categories of modules over the Lie algebra $sl_n$. The review is intended to give non-experts in representation theory who are familiar with the topological aspects of categorification (lifting quantum link invariants to homology theories) an idea for the sort of categories that appear when link homology is extended to tangles.

Title: Algebraic categories whose projectives are explicitly free
Authors: Mat&iacute;as Menni
Abstract: Let M = (M, m, u) be a monad and let (MX, m) be the free M-algebra on the object X. Consider an M-algebra (A, a), a retraction r : (MX, m) --> (A, a) and a section t : (A, a) --> (MX, m) of r. The retract (A, a) is not free in general. We observe that for many monads with a `combinatorial flavor' such a retract is not only a free algebra (MA_0, m), but it is also the case that the object A_0 of generators is determined in a canonical way by the section t. We give a precise form of this property, prove a characterization, and discuss examples from combinatorics, universal algebra, convexity and topos theory.

Title: Vector fields and flows on differentiable stacks
Authors: Richard Hepworth
Abstract: This paper introduces the notions of vector field and flow on a general differentiable stack. Our main theorem states that the flow of a vector field on a compact proper differentiable stack exists and is unique up to a uniquely determined 2-cell. This extends the usual result on the existence and uniqueness of flows on a manifold as well as the author's existing results for orbifolds. It sets the scene for a discussion of Morse Theory on a general proper stack and also paves the way for the categorification of other key aspects of differential geometry such as the tangent bundle and the Lie algebra of vector fields.

Title: Homotopical interpretation of globular complex by multipointed d-space
Authors: Philippe Gaucher
Abstract: Globular complexes were introduced by E. Goubault and the author to model higher dimensional automata. Globular complexes are topological spaces equipped with a globular decomposition which is the directed analogue of the cellular decomposition of a CW-complex. We prove that there exists a combinatorial model category such that the cellular objects are exactly the globular complexes and such that the homotopy category is equivalent to the homotopy category of flows. The underlying category of this model category is a variant of M. Grandis' notion of d-space over a topological space colimit generated by simplices. This result enables us to understand the relationship between the framework of flows and other works in directed algebraic topology using d-spaces. It also enables us to prove that the underlying homotopy type functor of flows can be interpreted up to equivalences of categories as the total left derived functor of a left Quillen adjoint.

Title: Cartesian differential categories
Authors: R. F. Blute, J. R. B. Cockett, R. A. G. Seely
Abstract: This paper revisits the authors' notion of a <i>differential category</i> from a different perspective. A differential category is an additive symmetric monoidal category with a comonad (a "coalgebra modality") and a differential combinator. The morphisms of a differential category should be thought of as the linear maps; the differentiable or smooth maps would then be morphisms of the coKleisli category. The purpose of the present paper is to directly axiomatize differentiable maps and thus to move the emphasis from the linear notion to structures resembling the coKleisli category. The result is a setting with a more evident and intuitive relationship to the familiar notion of calculus on smooth maps. Indeed a primary example is the category whose objects are Euclidean spaces and whose morphisms are smooth maps.

Title: Homology of n-fold groupoids
Authors: Tomas Everaert, Marino Gran
Abstract: Any semi-abelian category A appears, via the discrete functor, as a full replete reflective subcategory of the semi-abelian category of internal groupoids in A. This allows one to study the homology of $n$-fold internal groupoids with coefficients in a semi-abelian category A, and to compute explicit higher Hopf formulae. The crucial concept making such computations possible is the notion of protoadditive functor, which can be seen as a natural generalisation of the notion of additive functor.

Title: The comprehensive factorization and torsors
Authors: Ross Street, Dominic Verity
Abstract: This is an expanded, revised and corrected version of the first author's 1981 preprint. The discussion of one-dimensional cohomology $H^{1}$ in a fairly general category E involves passing to the 2-category Cat(E) of categories E. In particular, the coefficient object is a category B in E and the torsors that $H^{1}$ classifies are particular functors in E. We only impose conditions on E that are satisfied also by Cat(E) and argue that $H^{1}$ for Cat(E) is a kind of $H^{2}$ for E, and so on recursively. For us, it is too much to ask E to be a topos (or even internally complete) since, even if E is, Cat(E) is not. With this motivation, we are led to examine morphisms in E which act as internal families and to internalize the comprehensive factorization of functors into a final functor followed by a discrete fibration. We define B-torsors for a category B in E and prove clutching and classification theorems. The former theorem clutches Cech cocycles to construct torsors while the latter constructs a coefficient category to classify structures locally isomorphic to members of a given internal family of structures. We conclude with applications to examples.

Title: Monadic approach to Galois descent and cohomology
Authors: Francis Borceux, Stefaan Caenepeel, George Janelidze
Abstract: We describe a simplified categorical approach to Galois descent theory. It is well known that Galois descent is a special case of Grothendieck descent, and that under mild additional conditions the category of Grothendieck descent data coincides with the Eilenberg-Moore category of algebras over a suitable monad. This also suggests using monads directly, and our monadic approach to Galois descent makes no reference to Grothendieck descent theory at all. In order to make Galois descent constructions perfectly clear, we also describe their connections with some other related constructions of categorical algebra, and make various explicit calculations, especially with 1-cocycles and 1-dimensional non-abelian cohomology, usually omitted in the literature.

Abstract: In this paper we show that in a homological category in the sense of F. Borceux and D. Bourn, the notion of an internal precrossed module corresponding to a star-multiplicative graph, in the sense of G. Janelidze, can be obtained by directly internalizing the usual axioms of a crossed module, via equivariance. We then exhibit some sufficient conditions on a homological category under which this notion coincides with the notion of an internal crossed module due to G. Janelidze. We show that this is the case for any category of distributive $\Omega_2$-groups, in particular for the categories of groups with operations in the sense of G. Orzech.

Abstract: Protomodularity, in the pointed case, is equivalent to the Split Short Five Lemma. It is also well known that this condition implies that every internal category is in fact an internal groupoid. In this work, this is condition (II) and we introduce two other conditions denoted (I) and (III). Under condition (I), every multiplicative graph is an internal category. Under condition (III), every star-multiplicative graph can be extended (uniquely) to a multiplicative graph, a problem raised by G. Janelidze in the semiabelian context.

Title: A metric tangential calculus
Authors: Elisabeth Burroni, Jacques Penon
Abstract: The metric jets, introduced here, generalize the jets (at order one) of Charles Ehresmann. In short, for a ``good'' map f (said to be ``tangentiable'' at a) between metric spaces, we define its metric jet tangent at a (composed of all the maps which are locally lipschitzian at a and tangent to f at a) called the ``tangential'' of f at a, and denoted Tf_a. So, in this metric context, we define a ``new differentiability'' (called ``tangentiability'') which extends the classical differentiability (while preserving most of its properties) to new maps, traditionally pathologic.

Title: The pointed subobject functor, 3 x 3 lemmas, and subtractivity of spans
Authors: Zurab Janelidze
Abstract: The notion of a <i>subtractive category</i> recently introduced by the author, is a pointed categorical counterpart of the notion of a <i>subtractive variety</i> of universal algebras in the sense of A.~Ursini (recall that a variety is subtractive if its theory contains a constant 0 and a binary term s satisfying s(x,x)=0 and s(x,0)=x). Let us call a pointed regular category $\mathbb{C}$ <i>normal</i> if every regular epimorphism in $\mathbb{C}$ is a normal epimorphism. It is well known that any <i>homological category</i> in the sense of F. Borceux and D. Bourn is both normal and subtractive. We prove that in any subtractive normal category, the upper and lower $3\times 3$ lemmas hold true, which generalizes a similar result for homological categories due to D. Bourn (note that the middle $3\times 3$ lemma holds true if and only if the category is homological). The technique of proof is new: the pointed subobject functor $\mathcal{S}=\mathrm{Sub}(-):\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbf{Set}_*$ turns out to have suitable preservation/reflection properties which allow us to reduce the proofs of these two diagram lemmas to the standard diagram-chasing arguments in $\mathbf{Set}_*$ (alternatively, we could use the more advanced embedding theorem for regular categories due to M.~Barr). The key property of $\mathcal{S}$, which allows to obtain these diagram lemmas, is the preservation of <i>subtractive spans</i>. Subtractivity of a span provides a weaker version of the <i>rule of subtraction</i> --- one of the <i>elementary rules for chasing diagrams</i> in abelian categories, in the sense of S. Mac Lane. A pointed regular category is subtractive if and only if every span in it is subtractive, and moreover, the functor $\mathcal{S}$ not only preserves but also reflects subtractive spans. Thus, subtractivity seems to be exactly what we need in order to prove the upper/lower $3\times 3$ lemmas in a normal category. Indeed, we show that a normal category is subtractive if and only if these $3\times 3$ lemmas hold true in it. Moreover, we show that for any pointed regular category $\mathbb{C}$ (not necessarily a normal one), we have: $\mathbb{C}$ is subtractive if and only if the lower $3\times 3$ lemma holds true in $\mathbb{C}$.

Abstract: We present a general treatment of measures and integrals in certain (monoidal closed) categories. Under appropriate conditions the integral can be defined by a universal property, and the universal measure is at the same time a universal multiplicative measure. In the multiplicative case this assignment is right adjoint to the formation of the Boolean algebra of idempotents. Now coproduct preservation yields an approach to product measures.

Abstract: Sifted colimits, important for algebraic theories, are "almost" just the combination of filtered colimits and reflexive coequalizers. For example, given a finitely cocomplete category $\cal A$, then a functor with domain $\cal A$ preserves sifted colimits iff it preserves filtered colimits and reflexive coequalizers. But for general categories $\cal A$ that statement is not true: we provide a counter-example.

Title: The Frobenius relations meet linear distributivity
Authors: J. M. Egger
Abstract: The notion of Frobenius algebra originally arose in ring theory, but it is a fairly easy observation that this notion can be extended to arbitrary monoidal categories. But, is this really the correct level of generalisation? For example, when studying Frobenius algebras in the *-autonomous category $\Sup$, the standard concept using only the usual tensor product is less interesting than a similar one in which both the usual tensor product and its de Morgan dual (<i>par</i>) are used. Thus we maintain that the notion of linear-distributive category (which has both a tensor and a par, but is nevertheless more general than the notion of monoidal category) provides the correct framework in which to interpret the concept of Frobenius algebra.

Authors: Jonathon Funk, Pieter Hofstra
Abstract: We define the notion of a torsor for an inverse semigroup, which is based on semigroup actions, and prove that this is precisely the structure classified by the topos associated with an inverse semigroup. Unlike in the group case, not all set-theoretic torsors are isomorphic: we shall give a complete description of the category of torsors. We explain how a semigroup prehomomorphism gives rise to an adjunction between a restrictions-of-scalars functor and a tensor product functor, which we relate to the theory of covering spaces and E-unitary semigroups. We also interpret for semigroups the Lawvere-product of a sheaf and distributio$ and finally, we indicate how the theory might be extended to general semigroups, by defining a notion of torsor and a classifying topos for those.

Title: Transversal homotopy theory
Authors: Jonathan Woolf
Abstract: Implementing an idea due to John Baez and James Dolan we define new invariants of Whitney stratified manifolds by considering the homotopy theory of smooth transversal maps. To each Whitney stratified manifold we assign transversal homotopy monoids, one for each natural number. The assignment is functorial for a natural class of maps which we call stratified normal submersions. When the stratification is trivial the transversal homotopy monoids are isomorphic to the usual homotopy groups. We compute some simple examples and explore the elementary properties of these invariants. We also assign `higher invariants', the transversal homotopy categories, to each Whitney stratified manifold. These have a rich structure; they are rigid monoidal categories for n > 1 and ribbon categories for n > 2. As an example we show that the transversal homotopy categories of a sphere, stratified by a point and its complement, are equivalent to categories of framed tangles.

Abstract: Variations on the notions of Reedy model structures and projective model structures on categories of diagrams in a model category are introduced. These allow one to choose only a subset of the entries when defining weak equivalences, or to use different model categories at different entries of the diagrams. As a result, a bisimplicial model category that can be used to recover the algebraic K-theory for any Waldhausen subcategory of a model category is produced.

Title: Finitely presentable morphisms in exact sequences
Authors: Michel H&eacute;bert
Abstract: Let $\cal K$ be a locally finitely presentable category. If $\cal K$ is abelian and the sequence <br /> $$ 0 \to K \to^k X \to^c C \to 0$$ <br /> is short exact, we show that 1) $K$ is finitely generated iff $c$ is finitely presentable; 2) $k$ is finitely presentable iff $C$ is finitely presentable. The ``if" directions fail for semi-abelian varieties. We show that all but (possibly) 2)(if) follow from analogous properties which hold in all locally finitely presentable categories. As for 2)(if), it holds as soon as $\cal K$ is also co-homological, and all its strong epimorphisms are regular. Finally, locally finitely coherent (resp. noetherian) abelian categories are characterized as those for which all finitely presentable morphisms have finitely generated (resp. presentable) kernel objects.

Title: The Hopf algebra of M&ouml;bius intervals
Authors: F. W. Lawvere, M. Menni
Abstract: An unpublished result by the first author states that there exists a Hopf algebra $H$ such that for any M&ouml;bius category $\cal C$ (in the sense of Leroux) there exists a canonical algebra morphism from the dual $H^*$ of $H$ to the incidence algebra of $\cal C$. Moreover, the M&ouml;bius inversion principle in incidence algebras follows from a `master' inversion result in $H^*$. The underlying module of $H$ was originally defined as the free module on the set of iso classes of <i>M&ouml;bius intervals</i>, i.e. M&ouml;bius categories with initial and terminal objects. Here we consider a category of M&ouml;bius intervals and construct the Hopf algebra via the objective approach applied to a monoidal extensive category of combinatorial objects, with the values in appropriate rings being abstracted from combinatorial functors on the objects. The explicit consideration of a category of M&ouml;bius intervals leads also to two new characterizations of M&ouml;bius categories. <p> Keywords: M&ouml;bius category, incidence algebra

Title: Lax Presheaves and Exponentiability
Authors: Susan Niefield
Abstract: The category of <b>Set</b>-valued presheaves on a small category <i>B</i> is a topos. Replacing <b>Set</b> by a bicategory <b>S</b> whose objects are sets and morphisms are spans, relations, or partial maps, we consider a category Lax(<i>B</i>, <b>S</b>) of <b>S</b>-valued lax functors on <i>B</i>. When <b>S</b> = <b>Span</b>, the resulting category is equivalent to <b>Cat</b>/<i>B</i>, and hence, is rarely even cartesian closed. Restricting this equivalence gives rise to exponentiability characterizations for Lax(<i>B</i>, <b>Rel</b>) by Niefield and for Lax(<i>B</i>, <b>Par</b>) in this paper. Along the way, we obtain a characterization of those <i>B</i> for which the category <b>UFL</b>/<i>B</i> is a coreflective subcategory of <b>Cat</b>/<i>B</i>, and hence, a topos. <p> Keywords: span, relation, partial map, topos, cartesian closed, exponentiable, presheaf

Title: The span construction
Authors: Robert Dawson, Robert Par&eacute;, Dorette Pronk
Abstract: We present two generalizations of the Span construction. The first generalization gives Span of a category with all pullbacks as a (weak) double category. This double category Span <b>A</b> can be viewed as the free double category on the vertical category <b>A</b> where every vertical arrow has both a companion and a conjoint (and these companions and conjoints are adjoint to each other). Thus defined, Span : <b>Cat</b> --> <b>Doub</b> becomes a 2-functor, which is a partial left bi-adjoint to the forgetful functor Vrt : <b>Doub</b> --> <b>Cat</b>, which sends a double category to its category of vertical arrows.

Authors: Michael Barr, John F. Kennison, R. Raphael
Abstract: Let R be a commutative ring whose complete ring of quotients is R-injective. We show that the category of topological R-modules contains a full subcategory that is *-autonomous using R itself as dualizing object. In order to do this, we develop a new variation on the category chu(D,R), where D is the category of discrete R-modules: the high wide subcategory, which we show equivalent to the category of reflexive topological modules.

Abstract: We present a doctrinal approach to category theory, obtained by abstracting from the indexed inclusion (via discrete fibrations and opfibrations) of left and of right actions of X in Cat in categories over X. Namely, a ``weak temporal doctrine'' consists essentially of two indexed functors with the same codomain such that the induced functors have both left and right adjoints satisfying some exactness conditions, in the spirit of categorical logic.

Abstract: A combinatorial category <i>Disk</i> was introduced by Andr&eacute; Joyal to play a role in his definition of weak $\omega$-category.

Title: Internal profunctors and commutator theory; applications to extensions classification and categorical Galois Theory
Authors: Dominique Bourn
Abstract: We clarify the relationship between internal profunctors and connectors on pairs (R,S) of equivalence relations which originally appeared in our new profunctorial approach of the Schreier-Mac Lane extension theorem. This clarification allows us to extend this Schreier-Mac Lane theorem to any exact Mal'cev category with centralizers. On the other hand, still in the Mal'cev context and in respect to the categorical Galois theory associated with a reflection I, it allows us to produce the faithful action of a certain abelian group on the set of classes (up to isomorphism) of I-normal extensions having a given Galois groupoid.

Title: Higher Dimensional Algebra VII: Groupoidification
Authors: John C. Baez, Alexander E. Hoffnung, Christopher D. Walker
Abstract: Groupoidification is a form of categorification in which vector spaces are replaced by groupoids and linear operators are replaced by spans of groupoids. We introduce this idea with a detailed exposition of `degroupoidification': a systematic process that turns groupoids and spans into vector spaces and linear operators. Then we present three applications of groupoidification. The first is to Feynman diagrams. The Hilbert space for the quantum harmonic oscillator arises naturally from degroupoidifying the groupoid of finite sets and bijections. This allows for a purely combinatorial interpretation of creation and annihilation operators, their commutation relations, field operators, their normal-ordered powers, and finally Feynman diagrams. The second application is to Hecke algebras. We explain how to groupoidify the Hecke algebra associated to a Dynkin diagram whenever the deformation parameter $q$ is a prime power. We illustrate this with the simplest nontrivial example, coming from the $A_2$ Dynkin diagram. In this example we show that the solution of the Yang--Baxter equation built into the $A_2$ Hecke algebra arises naturally from the axioms of projective geometry applied to the projective plane over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. The third application is to Hall algebras. We explain how the standard construction of the Hall algebra from the category of $\mathbb{F}_q$ representations of a simply-laced quiver can be seen as an example of degroupoidification. This in turn provides a new way to categorify - or more precisely, groupoidify - the positive part of the quantum group associated to the quiver.

Title: A unified framework for generalized multicategories
Authors: G. S. H. Cruttwell, Michael A. Shulman
Abstract: Notions of generalized multicategory have been defined in numerous contexts throughout the literature, and include such diverse examples as symmetric multicategories, globular operads, Lawvere theories, and topological spaces. In each case, generalized multicategories are defined as the ``lax algebras'' or ``Kleisli monoids'' relative to a ``monad'' on a bicategory. However, the meanings of these words differ from author to author, as do the specific bicategories considered. We propose a unified framework: by working with monads on double categories and related structures (rather than bicategories), one can define generalized multicategories in a way that unifies all previous examples, while at the same time simplifying and clarifying much of the theory.

Abstract: Quantum categories were introduced by Day and Street as generalizations of both bi(co)algebroids and small categories. We clarify details of that work. In particular, we show explicitly how the monadic definition of a quantum category unpacks to a set of axioms close to the definitions of a bialgebroid in the Hopf algebraic literature. We introduce notions of functor and natural transformation for quantum categories and consider various constructions on quantum structures.

Title: A remark about the Connes fusion tensor product
Authors: Andreas Thom
Abstract: We analyze the algebraic structure of the Connes fusion tensor product (CFTP) in the case of bi-finite Hilbert modules over a von Neumann algebra M. It turns out that all complications in its definition disappear if one uses the closely related bi-modules of bounded vectors. We construct an equivalence of monoidal categories with duality between a category of Hilbert bi-modules over M with CFTP and some natural category of bi-modules over M with the usual relative algebraic tensor product.

Abstract: We study the condition, on a connected and locally connected geometric morphism $p : \cal E \to \cal S$, that the canonical natural transformation $p_*\to p_!$ should be (pointwise) epimorphic - a condition which F.W. Lawvere called the `Nullstellensatz', but which we prefer to call `punctual local connectedness'. We show that this condition implies that $p_!$ preserves finite products, and that, for bounded morphisms between toposes with natural number objects, it is equivalent to being both local and hyperconnected.

Title: Comparative smootheology
Authors: Andrew Stacey
Abstract: We compare various different definitions of "the category of smooth objects". The definitions compared are due to Chen, Frolicher, Sikorski, Smith, and Souriau. The method of comparison is to construct functors between the categories that enable us to see how the categories relate to each other. Our method of study involves finding a general context into which these categories can be placed. This involves considering categories wherein objects are considered in relation to a certain collection of standard test objects. This therefore applies beyond the question of categories of smooth spaces.

Title: Monoidal functor categories and graphic Fourier transforms
Authors: Brian J. Day
Abstract: This article represents a preliminary attempt to link Kan extensions, and some of their further developments, to Fourier theory and quantum algebra through *-autonomous monoidal categories and related structures. There is a close resemblance to convolution products and the Wiener algebra (of transforms) in functional analysis. The analysis term ``kernel'' (of a distribution) has also been adapted below in connection with certain special types of ``distributors'' (in the terminology of J. Benabou) or ``modules'' (in the terminology of R. Street) in category theory. In using the term ``graphic'', in a very broad sense, we are clearly distinguishing the categorical methods employed in this article from standard Fourier and wavelet mathematics. The term ``graphic'' also applies to promultiplicative graphs, and related concepts, which can feature prominently in the theory.

Title: An embedding theorem for adhesive categories
Authors: Stephen Lack
Abstract: Adhesive categories are categories which have pushouts with one leg a monomorphism, all pullbacks, and certain exactness conditions relating these pushouts and pullbacks. We give a new proof of the fact that every topos is adhesive. We also prove a converse: every small adhesive category has a fully faithful functor in a topos, with the functor preserving the all the structure. Combining these two results, we see that the exactness conditions in the definition of adhesive category are exactly the relationship between pushouts along monomorphisms and pullbacks which hold in any topos.

Abstract: We formulate an elementary condition on an involutive quantaloid $Q$ under which there is a distributive law from the Cauchy completion monad over the symmetrisation comonad on the category of $Q$-enriched categories. For such quantaloids, which we call Cauchy-bilateral quantaloids, it follows that the Cauchy completion of any symmetric $Q$-enriched category is again symmetric. Examples include Lawvere's quantale of non-negative real numbers and Walters' small quantaloids of closed cribles.

Authors: Ulrich H&ouml;hle
Abstract: For small involutive and integral quantaloids ${\cal Q}$ it is shown that covariant presheaves on symmetric ${\cal Q}$-categories are equivalent to certain subalgebras of a specific monad on the category of symmetric ${\cal Q}$-categories. This construction is related to a weakening of the subobject classifier axiom which does not require the classification of all subalgebras, but only guarantees that classifiable subalgebras are uniquely classifiable. As an application the identification of closed left ideals of non-commutative $C^*$-algebras with certain "open", subalgebras of freely generated algebras is given.

Title: The Faa di Bruno construction
Authors: J. R. B. Cockett, R. A. G. Seely
Abstract: In the context of Cartesian differential categories, the structure of the first-order chain rule gives rise to a fibration, the ``bundle category''. In the present paper we generalise this to the higher-order chain rule (originally developed in the traditional setting by Fa&agrave; di Bruno in the nineteenth century); given any Cartesian differential category X, there is a ``higher-order chain rule fibration'' Faa(X) --> X over it. In fact, Faa is a comonad (over the category of Cartesian left (semi-)additive categories). Our main theorem is that the coalgebras for this comonad are precisely the Cartesian differential categories. In a sense, this result affirms the ``correctness'' of the notion of Cartesian differential categories.

Title: Symbolic dynamics and the category of graphs
Authors: Terrence Bisson, Aristide Tsemo
Abstract: Symbolic dynamics is partly the study of walks in a directed graph. By a walk, here we mean a morphism to the graph from the Cayley graph of the monoid of non-negative integers. Sets of these walks are also important in other areas, such as stochastic processes, automata, combinatorial group theory, $C^*$-algebras, etc. We put a Quillen model structure on the category of directed graphs, for which the weak equivalences are those graph morphisms which induce bijections on the set of walks. We determine the resulting homotopy category. We also introduce a "finite-level" homotopy category which respects the natural topology on the set of walks. To each graph we associate a basal graph, well defined up to isomorphism. We show that the basal graph is a homotopy invariant for our model structure, and that it is a finer invariant than the zeta series of a finite graph. We also show that, for finite walkable graphs, if $B$ is basal and separated then the walk spaces for $X$ and $B$ are topologically conjugate if and only if $X$ and $B$ are homotopically equivalent for our model structure.

That is, for any 2-category $cal K$ and for any non-negative integer $n$, we introduce 2-categories $\Wdl^{(n)}(\cal K)$, of $(n+1)$-tuples of monads in $\cal K$ pairwise related by weak distributive laws obeying the Yang-Baxter equation. The first instance $\Wdl^{(0)}(\cal K)$ coincides with $\Mnd(\cal K)$, the usual 2-category of monads in $\cal K$, and for other values of $n$, $\Wdl^{(n)}(\cal K)$ contains $\Mnd^{n+1}(\cK)$ as a full 2-subcategory. For the local idempotent closure $\overline \cal K$ of $\cal K$, extending the multiplication of the 2-monad $\Mnd$, we equip these 2-categories with $n$ possible `weak wreath product' 2-functors $\Wdl^{(n)}(\ocK)\to \Wdl^{(n-1)}(\overline \cal K)$, such that all of their possible $n$-fold composites $\Wdl^{(n)}(\overline \cal K)\to \Wdl^{(0)}(\overline \cal K)$ are equal; that is, such that the weak wreath product is `associative'. Whenever idempotent 2-cells in $\cal K$ split, this leads to pseudofunctors $\Wdl^{(n)}(\cal K)\to \Wdl^{(n-1)}(\cal K)$ obeying the associativity property up-to isomorphism. We present a practically important occurrence of an iterated weak wreath product: the algebra of observable quantities in an Ising type quantum spin chain where the spins take their values in a dual pair of finite weak Hopf algebras. We also construct a fully faithful embedding of $\Wdl^{(n)}(\overline \cal K)$ into the 2-category of commutative $n+1$ dimensional cubes in $\Mnd(\overline \cal K)$ (hence into the 2-category of commutative $n+1$ dimensional cubes in $\cal K$ whenever $\cal K$ has Eilenberg-Moore objects and its idempotent 2-cells split). Finally we give a sufficient and necessary condition on a monad in $\overline \cal K$ to be isomorphic to an $n$-ary weak wreath product.

Title: On diagram-chasing in double complexes
Authors: George M. Bergman
Abstract: We construct, for any double complex in an abelian category, certain ``short-distance'' maps, and an exact sequence involving these, instances of which can be pieced together to give the ``long-distance'' maps and exact sequences of results such as the Snake Lemma. Further applications are given. We also note what the building blocks of an analogous study of triple complexes would be.

Title: Graphical Methods for Tannaka duality]{Graphical Methods for Tannaka duality of weak bialgebras and weak Hopf algebras
Authors: Micah Blake McCurdy
Abstract: Tannaka duality describes the relationship between algebraic objects in a given category and functors into that category; an important case is that of Hopf algebras and their categories of representations; these have strong monoidal forgetful ``fibre functors'' to the category of vector spaces. We simultaneously generalize the theory of Tannaka duality in two ways: first, we replace Hopf algebras with <i>weak Hopf algebras</i> and strong monoidal functors with <i>separable Frobenius monoidal functors</i>; second, we replace the category of vector spaces with an arbitrary braided monoidal category. To accomplish this goal, we make use of a graphical notation for functors between monoidal categories, using string diagrams with <i>coloured regions</i>. Not only does this notation extend our capacity to give simple proofs of complicated calculations, it makes plain some of the connections between Frobenius monoidal or separable Frobenius monoidal functors and the topology of the axioms defining certain algebraic structures. Finally, having generalized Tannaka duality to an arbitrary base category, we briefly discuss the functoriality of the construction as this base is varied.

Title: Notes on Bimonads and Hopf Monads
Authors: Bachuki Mesablishvili, Robert Wisbauer
Abstract: For a generalisation of the classical theory of Hopf algebra over fields, A. Brugui&egrave;eres and A. Virelizier study opmonoidal monads on monoidal categories (which they called <i>bimonads,</i>). In a recent joint paper with S. Lack the same authors define the notion of a <i>pre-Hopf monad</i> by requiring only a special form of the fusion operator to be invertible. In previous papers it was observed by the present authors that bimonads yield a special case of an entwining of a pair of functors (on arbitrary categories). The purpose of this note is to show that in this setting the pre-Hopf monads are a special case of Galois entwinings. As a byproduct some new properties are detected which make a (general) bimonad on a Cauchy complete category to a Hopf monad. In the final section applications to cartesian monoidal categories are considered.

Title: The coalgebraic structure of cell complexes
Authors: Thomas Athorne
Abstract: The relative cell complexes with respect to a generating set of cofibrations are an important class of morphisms in any model structure. In the particular case of the standard (algebraic) model structure on <b>Top</b>, we give a new expression of these morphisms by defining a category of relative cell complexes, which has a forgetful functor to the arrow category. This allows us to prove a conjecture of Richard Garner: considering the algebraic weak factorisation system given in that algebraic model structure between cofibrations and trivial fibrations, we show that the category of relative cell complexes is equivalent to the category of coalgebras.

Title: Skew monoidales, skew warpings and quantum categories
Authors: Stephen Lack, Ross Street
Abstract: Kornel Szlachanyi recently used the term skew-monoidal category for a particular laxified version of monoidal category. He showed that bialgebroids $H$ with base ring $R$ could be characterized in terms of skew-monoidal structures on the category of one-sided $R$-modules for which the lax unit was $R$ itself. We define skew monoidales (or skew pseudo-monoids) in any monoidal bicategory $\cal M$. These are skew-monoidal categories when $\cal M$ is $Cat$. Our main results are presented at the level of monoidal bicategories. However, a consequence is that quantum categories with base comonoid $C$ in a suitably complete braided monoidal category $\CV$ are precisely skew monoidales in $Comod (\cal V)$ with unit coming from the counit of $C$. Quantum groupoids (in the sense of Chikhladze et al rather than Day and Street) are those skew monoidales with invertible associativity constraint. In fact, we provide some very general results connecting opmonoidal monads and skew monoidales. We use a lax version of the concept of warping defined by Booker and Street to modify monoidal structures. <p> Keywords: bialgebroid; fusion operator; quantum category; monoidal bicategory; monoidale; skew-monoidal category; comonoid; Hopf monad

Title: Range Categories I: General Theory
Authors: J. R. B. Cockett, Xiuzhan Guo, Pieter Hofstra
Abstract: In this two-part paper, we undertake a systematic study of abstract partial map categories in which every map has both a restriction (domain of definition) and a range (image). In this first part, we explore connections with related structures such as inverse categories and allegories, and establish two representational results. The first of these explains how every range category can be fully and faithfully embedded into a category of partial maps equipped with a suitable factorization system. The second is a generalization of a result from semigroup theory by Boris Schein, and says that every small range category satisfying the additional condition that every map is an epimorphism onto its range can be faithfully embedded into the category of sets and partial functions with the usual notion of range. Finally, we give an explicit construction of the free range category on a partial map category in terms of certain types of labeled trees.

Abstract: In this paper, which is the second part of a study of partial map categories with images, we investigate the interaction between images and various other kinds of categorical structure and properties. In particular, we consider images in the context of partial products, meets and discreteness and survey a taxonomy of structures leading towards the partial map categories of regular categories. We also present a term logic for cartesian partial map categories with images and prove a soundness and completeness theorem for this logic. Finally, we exhibit several free constructions relating the different classes of categories under consideration.

It also gives an easy way to calculate the sources and targets of opetopes.

Title: Modeling Stable One-Types
Authors: Niles Johnson, Ang&eacute;lica M. Osorno
Abstract: Classification of homotopy $n$-types has focused on developing algebraic categories which are equivalent to categories of $n$-types. We expand this theory by providing algebraic models of homotopy-theoretic constructions for stable one-types. These include a model for the Postnikov one-truncation of the sphere spectrum, and for its action on the model of a stable one-type. We show that a bicategorical cokernel introduced by Vitale models the cofiber of a map between stable one-types, and apply this to develop an algebraic model for the Postnikov data of a stable one-type.

Abstract: We obtain semantic characterizations, holding for any Grothendieck site $(C, J)$, for the models of a theory classified by a topos of the form $Sh(C,J)$ in terms of the models of a theory classified by a topos $[C^{op}, Set]$. These characterizations arise from an appropriate representation of flat functors into Grothendieck toposes based on an application of the Yoneda Lemma in conjunction with ideas from indexed category theory, and turn out to be relevant also in different contexts, in particular for addressing questions in classical Model Theory.

Abstract: By the Lefschetz fixed point theorem, if an endomorphism of a topological space is fixed-point-free, then its Lefschetz number vanishes. This necessary condition is not usually sufficient, however; for that we need a refinement of the Lefschetz number called the Reidemeister trace. Abstractly, the Lefschetz number is a trace in a symmetric monoidal category, while the Reidemeister trace is a trace in a bicategory; in this paper we relate these contexts using indexed symmetric monoidal categories.

Abstract: Motivated by constructions in the theory of inverse semigroups and etale groupoids, we define and investigate the concept of isotropy from a topos-theoretic perspective. Our main conceptual tool is a monad on the category of grouped toposes. Its algebras correspond to a generalized notion of crossed module, which we call a crossed topos. As an application, we present a topos-theoretic characterization and generalization of the `Clifford, fundamental' sequence associated with an inverse semigroup.

Abstract: Given a double category $\mathbb D$ such that $\mathbb D_0$ has pushouts, we characterize oplax/lax adjunctions between $\mathbb D$ and $Cospan(\mathbb D_0)$ for which the right adjoint is normal and restricts to the identity on $\mathbb D_0$, where $Cospan(\mathbb D_0)$ is the double category on $\mathbb D_0$ whose vertical morphisms are cospans. We show that such a pair exists if and only if $\mathbb D$ has companions, conjoints, and 1-cotabulators. The right adjoints are induced by the companions and conjoints, and the left adjoints by the 1-cotabulators. The notion of a 1-cotabulator is a common generalization of the symmetric algebra of a module and Artin-Wraith glueing of toposes, locales, and topological spaces.

Title: D&eacute;calage and Kan's simplicial loop group functor
Authors: Danny Stevenson
Abstract: Given a bisimplicial set, there are two ways to extract from it a simplicial set: the diagonal simplicial set and the less well known total simplicial set of Artin and Mazur. There is a natural comparison map between these simplicial sets, and it is a theorem due to Cegarra and Remedios and independently Joyal and Tierney, that this comparison map is a weak homotopy equivalence for any bisimplicial set. In this paper we will give a new, elementary proof of this result. As an application, we will revisit Kan's simplicial loop group functor $G$. We will give a simple formula for this functor, which is based on a factorization, due to Duskin, of Eilenberg and Mac Lane's classifying complex functor $\overline{W}$. We will give a new, short, proof of Kan's result that the unit map for the adjunction $G\dashv \overline{W}$ is a weak homotopy equivalence for reduced simplicial sets.

Title: Exponentiability via double categories
Authors: Susan Niefield
Abstract: For a small category $B$ and a double category $\mathbb D$, let ${\rm Lax}_N(B,\mathbb D)$ denote the category whose objects are vertical normal lax functors $B\to\mathbb D$ and morphisms are horizontal lax transformations. It is well known that $Lax_N(B, \mathbb Cat) \simeq Cat/B$, where $\mathbb Cat$ is the double category of small categories, functors, and profunctors. We generalized this equivalence to certain double categories, in the case where $B$ is a finite poset. Street showed that $Y\to B$ is exponentiable in $Cat/B$ if and only if the corresponding normal lax functor $B\to \mathbb Cat$ is a pseudo-functor. Using our generalized equivalence, we show that a morphism $Y\to B$ is exponentiable in $ {\mathbb D}_0/B$ if and only if the corresponding normal lax functor $B\to\mathbb D$ is a pseudo-functor <i>plus</i> an additional condition that holds for all $X\to !B$ in $Cat$. Thus, we obtain a single theorem which yields characterizations of certain exponentiable morphisms of small categories, topological spaces, locales, and posets.

Abstract: A category is adhesive if it has all pullbacks, all push-outs along monomorphisms, and all exactness conditions between pullbacks and pushouts along monomorphisms which hold in a topos. This condition can be modified by considering only pushouts along regular monomorphisms, or by asking only for the exactness conditions which hold in a quasitopos. We prove four characterization theorems dealing with adhesive categories and their variants.

Abstract: We define a <i>strong relation</i> in a category $\mathbb{C}$ to be a span which is ``orthogonal'' to the class of jointly epimorphic pairs of morphisms. Under the presence of finite limits, a strong relation is simply a strong monomorphism $R\rightarrow X\times Y$. We show that a category $\mathbb{C}$ with pullbacks and equalizers is a weakly Mal'tsev category if and only if every reflexive strong relation in $\mathbb{C}$ is an equivalence relation. In fact, we obtain a more general result which includes, as its another particular instance, a similar well-known characterization of Mal'tsev categories.

Abstract: We investigate $3$-permutability, in the sense of universal algebra, in an abstract categorical setting which unifies the pointed and the non-pointed contexts in categorical algebra. This leads to a unified treatment of regular subtractive categories and of regular Goursat categories, as well as of $E$-subtractive varieties (where $E$ is the set of constants in a variety) recently introduced by the fourth author. As an application, we show that ``ideals'' coincide with ``clots'' in any regular subtractive category, which can be considered as a pointed analogue of a known result for regular Goursat categories.

Title: The Ursini commutator as normalized Smith-Pedicchio commutator
Authors: Sandra Mantovani
Abstract: We introduce an intrinsic description of the Ursini commutator in any ideal determined category and we compare it with the Higgins and Huq commutators. After describing also the Smith-Pedicchio commutator by means of canonical arrows from a coproduct, we compare the two notions, showing that in any exact Mal'tsev normal category the Ursini commutator $[H,K]_{U}$ of two subobjects $H, K$ of $A$ is the normalization of the Smith-Pedicchio commutator of the equivalence relations generated by $H$ and $K$, extending the result valid for ideal determined varieties given by Ursini and Gumm.

Title: Higher central extensions via commutators
Authors: Diana Rodelo, Tim Van der Linden
Abstract: We prove that all semi-abelian categories with the the <i>Smith is Huq</i> property satisfy the <i>Commutator Condition</i>(CC): higher central extensions may be characterised in terms of binary (Huq or Smith) commutators. In fact, even Higgins commutators suffice. As a consequence, in the presence of enough projectives we obtain explicit Hopf formulae for homology with coefficients in the abelianisation functor, and an interpretation of cohomology with coefficients in an abelian object in terms of equivalence classes of higher central extensions. We also give a counterexample against (CC) in the semi-abelian category of (commutative) loops.

Title: Descent in monoidal categories
Authors: Bachuki Mesablishvili
Abstract: We consider a symmetric monoidal closed category $V = (V, \otimes, I, [-,-])$ together with a regular injective object $Q$ such that the functor $[-, Q] : \to V^{op}$ is comonadic and prove that in such a category, as in the monoidal category of abelian groups, a morphism of commutative monoids is an effective descent morphism for modules if and only if it is a pure monomorphism. Examples of this kind of monoidal categories are elementary toposes considered as cartesian closed monoidal categories, the module categories over a commutative ring object in a Grothendieck topos and Barr's star-autonomous categories.

Title: Lawvere completeness as a topological property
Authors: Serdar Sozubek
Abstract: Lawvere's notion of completeness for quantale-enriched categories has been extended to the theory of lax algebras under the name of L-completeness. In this paper we introduce the corresponding morphism concept and examine its properties. We explore some important relativized topological concepts like separatedness, denseness, compactness and compactification with respect to L-complete morphisms. Moreover, we show that separated L-complete morphisms belong to a factorization system.

Title: Generalized Hopf modules for bimonads
Authors: Marcelo Aguiar, Stephen U. Chase
Abstract: Brugui&egrave;res, Lack and Virelizier have recently obtained a vast generalization of Sweedler's <i>Fundamental Theorem of Hopf modules</i>, in which the role of the Hopf algebra is played by a bimonad. We present an extension of this result which involves, in addition to the bimonad, a comodule-monad and a algebra-comonoid over it. As an application we obtain a generalization of another classical theorem from the Hopf algebra literature, due to Schneider, which itself is an extension of Sweedler's result (to the setting of Hopf Galois extensions).

Title: On actions and strict actions in homological categories
Authors: Manfred Hartl, Bruno Loiseau
Abstract: Let $G$ be an object of a finitely cocomplete homological category $\mathbb C$. We study actions of $G$ on objects $A$ of $\mathbb C$ (defined by Bourn and Janelidze as being algebras over a certain monad $\mathbb T_G$), with two objectives: investigating to which extent actions can be described in terms of smaller data, called action cores; and to single out those abstract action cores which extend to actions corresponding to semi-direct products of $A$ and $G$ (in a non-exact setting, not every action does). This amounts to exhibiting a subcategory of the category of the actions of $G$ on objects $A$ which is equivalent with the category of points in $\mathbb C$ over $G$, and to describing it in terms of action cores. This notion and its study are based on a preliminary investigation of co-smash products, in which cross-effects of functors in a general categorical context turn out to be a useful tool. The co-smash products also allow us to define higher categorical commutators, different from the ones of Huq, which are not generally expressible in terms of nested binary ones. We use strict action cores to show that any normal subobject of an object $E$ (i.e., the equivalence class of $0$ for some equivalence relation on $E$ in $\mathbb C$) admits a strict conjugation action of $E$. If $\mathbb C$ is semi-abelian, we show that for subobjects $X$, $Y$ of some object $A$, $X$ is proper in the supremum of $X$ and $Y$ if and only if $X$ is stable under the restriction to $Y$ of the conjugation action of $A$ on itself. This also amounts to an alternative proof of Bourn and Janelidze's category equivalence between points over $G$ in $\mathbb C$ and actions of $G$ in the semi-abelian context. Finally, we show that the two axioms of an algebra which characterize $G$-actions are equivalent with three others ones, in terms of action cores. These axioms are commutative squares involving only co-smash products. Two of them are associativity type conditions which generalize the usual properties of an action of one group on another, while the third is kind of a higher coherence condition which is a consequence of the other two in the category of groups, but probably not in general. As an application, we characterize abelian action cores, that is, action cores corresponding to Beck modules; here also the coherence condition follows from the others.

Title: Composition of Modules for Lax Functors
Authors: Robert Par&eacute;
Abstract: We study the composition of modules between lax functors of weak double categories. We adapt the bicategorical notion of local cocompleteness to weak double categories, which the codomain of our lax functors will be assumed to satisfy. We introduce a notion of factorization of cells, which most weak double categories of interest possess, and which is sufficient to guarantee the strong representability of composites of modules between lax functors whose domain satisfies it.

Authors: Maria Emilia Maietti, Giuseppe Rosolini
Abstract: We extend the notion of exact completion on a category with weak finite limits to Lawvere's elementary doctrines. We show how any such doctrine admits an elementary quotient completion, which is the universal solution to adding certain quotients. We note that the elementary quotient completion can be obtained as the composite of two other universal constructions: one adds effective quotients, the other forces extensionality of morphisms. We also prove that each construction preserves comprehension.

Title: An equational metalogic for monadic equational systems
Authors: Marcelo Fiore
Abstract: The paper presents algebraic and logical developments. From the algebraic viewpoint, we introduce Monadic Equational Systems as an abstract enriched notion of equational presentation. From the logical viewpoint, we provide Equational Metalogic as a general formal deductive system for the derivability of equational consequences. Relating the two, a canonical model theory for Monadic Equational Systems is given and for it the soundness of Equational Metalogic is established. This development involves a study of clone and double-dualization structures. We also show that in the presence of free algebras %constructions the model theory of Monadic Equational Systems satisfies an internal strong-completeness property.

Abstract: One of the open problems in higher category theory is the systematic construction of the higher dimensional analogues of the Gray tensor product of 2-categories. In this paper we continue the developments of [Batanin-Weber, 2011], [Weber, 2011] and [Batanin-Cisinski-Weber, 2011] by understanding the natural generalisations of Gray's little brother, the funny tensor product of categories. In fact we exhibit for any higher categorical structure definable by a normalised n-operad in the sense of Batanin, an analogous tensor product which forms a symmetric monoidal closed structure on the category of algebras of the operad.

Title: Duality for distributive spaces
Authors: Dirk Hofmann
Abstract: The main source of inspiration for the present paper is the work of R. Rosebrugh and R.J. Wood on constructively completely distributive lattices where the authors elegantly employ the concepts of adjunction and module. Both notions (suitably adapted) are available in topology too, which permits us to investigate topological, metric and other kinds of spaces in a similar spirit. We introduce here the notion of distributive space and algebraic space and show in particular that the category of distributive spaces and colimit preserving maps is dually equivalent to the idempotent split completion of a category of spaces and convergence relations between them. We explain the connection of this result to the well-known duality between topological spaces and frames, and deduce further duality theorems.

Title: Semiunital semimonoidal categories (Applications to semirings and semicorings)
Authors: Jawad Abuhlail
Abstract: The category $_{A}\mathbb{S}_{A}$ of bisemimodules over a semialgebra $A,$ with the so called <i>Takahashi's tensor-like product</i> $-\boxtimes _{A}-,$ is semimonoidal but <i>not</i> monoidal. Although not a unit in $_{A}\mathbb{S}% _{A},$ the base semialgebra $A$ has properties of a <i>semiunit</i> (in a sense which we clarify in this note). Motivated by this interesting example, we investigate <i>semiunital semimonoidal categories</i> $(\mathcal{V}% ,\bullet ,\mathbf{I})$ as a framework for studying notions like <i>semimonoids (semicomonoids)</i> as well as a notion of monads (comonads) which we call $\mathbb{J}$-<i>monads</i> ($\mathbb{J}$-<i>comonads</i>) with respect to the endo-functor $\mathbb{J}:=\mathbf{I}\bullet -\simeq -\bullet \mathbf{I}:\mathcal{V}\longrightarrow \mathcal{V}.$ This motivated also introducing a more generalized notion of monads (comonads) in arbitrary categories with respect to arbitrary endo-functors. Applications to the semiunital semimonoidal variety $(_{A}\mathbb{S}_{A},\boxtimes _{A},A) $ provide us with examples of semiunital $A$-semirings (semicounital $A$-semicorings) and semiunitary semimodules (semicounitary semicomodules) which extend the classical notions of unital rings (counital corings) and unitary modules (counitary comodules).

Title: Tannaka duality and convolution for duoidal categories
Authors: Thomas Booker, Ross Street
Abstract: Given a horizontal monoid $M$ in a duoidal category $\cal F$, we examine the relationship between bimonoid structures on $M$ and monoidal structures on the category $\cal F^{\ast M}$ of right $M$-modules which lift the vertical monoidal structure of $\cal F$. We obtain our result using a variant of the so-called Tannaka adjunction; that is, an adjunction inducing the equivalence which expresses Tannaka duality. The approach taken utilizes hom-enriched categories rather than categories on which a monoidal category acts (``actegories''). The requirement of enrichment in $\cal F$ itself demands the existence of some internal homs, leading to the consideration of convolution for duoidal categories. Proving that certain hom-functors are monoidal, and so take monoids to monoids, unifies classical convolution in algebra and Day convolution for categories. Hopf bimonoids are defined leading to a lifting of closed structures on $\cal F$ to $\cal F^{\ast M}$. We introduce the concept of warping monoidal structures and this permits the construction of new duoidal categories.

Title: Tightly Bounded Completions
Authors: Marta Bunge
Abstract: By a `completion' on a 2-category K we mean here an idempotent pseudomonad on K. We are particularly interested in pseudomonads that arise from KZ-doctrines. Motivated by a question of Lawvere, we compare the Cauchy completion, defined in the setting of V-Cat for V a symmetric monoidal closed category, with the Grothendieck completion, defined in the setting of S-Indexed Cat for S a topos. To this end we introduce a unified setting (`indexed enriched category theory') in which to formulate and study certain properties of KZ-doctrines. We find that, whereas all of the KZ-doctrines that are relevant to this discussion (Karoubi, Cauchy, Stack, Grothendieck) may be regarded as `bounded', only the Cauchy and the Grothendieck completions are `tightly bounded' - two notions that we introduce and study in this paper. Tightly bounded KZ-doctrines are shown to be idempotent. We also show, in a different approach to answering the motivating question, that the Cauchy completion (defined using `distributors') and the Grothendieck completion (defined using `generalized functors') are actually equivalent constructions.

Abstract: We show that every geometric morphism between realizability toposes satisfies the condition that its inverse image commutes with the `constant object' functors, which was assumed by John Longley in his pioneering study of such morphisms. We also provide the answer to something which was stated as an open problem on Jaap van Oosten's book on realizability toposes: if a subtopos of a realizability topos is (co)complete, it must be either the topos of sets or the degenerate topos. And we present a new and simpler condition equivalent to the notion of computational density for applicative morphisms of Schonfinkel algebras.

Title: Codensity and the ultrafilter monad
Authors: Tom Leinster
Abstract: Even a functor without an adjoint induces a monad, namely, its codensity monad; this is subject only to the existence of certain limits. We clarify the sense in which codensity monads act as substitutes for monads induced by adjunctions. We also expand on an undeservedly ignored theorem of Kennison and Gildenhuys: that the codensity monad of the inclusion of (finite sets) into (sets) is the ultrafilter monad. This result is analogous to the correspondence between measures and integrals. So, for example, we can speak of integration against an ultrafilter. Using this language, we show that the codensity monad of the inclusion of (finite-dimensional vector spaces) into (vector spaces) is double dualization. From this it follows that compact Hausdorff spaces have a linear analogue: linearly compact vector spaces. Finally, we show that ultra<i>products</i> are categorically inevitable: the codensity monad of the inclusion of (finite families of sets) into (families of sets) is the ultraproduct monad.

Title: Bounded Archimedean l-algebras and Gelfand-Neumark-Stone duality
Authors: Guram Bezhanishvili, Patrick J. Morandi, Bruce Olberding
Abstract: By Gelfand-Neumark duality, the category $C^*Alg$ of commutative $C^*$-algebras is dually equivalent to the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, which by Stone duality, is also dually equivalent to the category $ubal$ of uniformly complete bounded Archimedean $\ell$-algebras. Consequently, $C^*Alg$ is equivalent to $ubal$, and this equivalence can be described through complexification. <p> In this article we study $ubal$ within the larger category $bal$ of bounded Archimedean $\ell$-algebras. We show that $ubal$ is the smallest nontrivial reflective subcategory of $bal$, and that $ubal$ consists of exactly those objects in $bal$ that are epicomplete, a fact that includes a categorical formulation of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem for $bal$. It follows that $ubal$ is the unique nontrivial reflective epicomplete subcategory of $bal$. We also show that each nontrivial reflective subcategory of $bal$ is both monoreflective and epireflective, and exhibit two other interesting reflective subcategories of $bal$ involving Gelfand rings and square closed rings. <p> Dually, we show that Specker ${\mathbb R}$-algebras are precisely the co-epicomplete objects in $bal$. We prove that the category $spec$ of Specker $\mathbb R$-algebras is a mono-coreflective subcategory of $bal$ that is co-epireflective in a mono-coreflective subcategory of $bal$ consisting of what we term $\ell$-clean rings, a version of clean rings adapted to the order-theoretic setting of $bal$. <p> We conclude the article by discussing the import of our results in the setting of complex $*$-algebras through complexification.

Title: Connections on non-Abelian gerbes and their holonomy
Authors: Urs Schreiber, Konrad Waldorf
Abstract: We introduce an axiomatic framework for the parallel transport of connections on gerbes. It incorporates parallel transport along curves and along surfaces, and is formulated in terms of gluing axioms and smoothness conditions. The smoothness conditions are imposed with respect to a strict Lie 2-group, which plays the role of a band, or structure 2-group. Upon choosing certain examples of Lie 2-groups, our axiomatic framework reproduces in a systematical way several known concepts of gerbes with connection: non-abelian differential cocycles, Breen-Messing gerbes, abelian and non-abelian bundle gerbes. These relationships convey a well-defined notion of surface holonomy from our axiomatic framework to each of these concrete models. Till now, holonomy was only known for abelian gerbes; our approach reproduces that known concept and extends it to non-abelian gerbes. Several new features of surface holonomy are exposed under its extension to non-abelian gerbes; for example, it carries an action of the mapping class group of the surface.

Abstract: Moerdijk's site description for equivariant sheaf toposes on open topological groupoids is used to give a proof for the (known, but apparently unpublished) proposition that if $H$ is a subgroupoid of an open topological groupoid $G$, then the topos of equivariant sheaves on $H$ is a subtopos of the topos of equivariant sheaves on $G$. This proposition is then applied to the study of quotient geometric theories and subtoposes. In particular, an intrinsic characterization is given of those subgroupoids that are definable by quotient theories.

Title: Categories enriched over a quantaloid: Isbell adjunctions and Kan adjunctions

Abstract: Each distributor between categories enriched over a small quantaloid Q gives rise to two adjunctions between the categories of contravariant and covariant presheaves, and hence to two monads. These two adjunctions are respectively generalizations of Isbell adjunctions and Kan extensions in category theory. It is proved that these two processes are functorial with infomorphisms playing as morphisms between distributors; and that the free cocompletion functor of Q-categories factors through both of these functors.

Title: Enriched indexed categories
Authors: Michael Shulman
Abstract: We develop a theory of categories which are simultaneously (1) indexed over a base category $S$ with finite products, and (2) enriched over an $S$-indexed monoidal category $V$. This includes classical enriched categories, indexed and fibered categories, and internal categories as special cases. We then describe the appropriate notion of ``limit'' for such enriched indexed categories, and show that they admit ``free cocompletions'' constructed as usual with a Yoneda embedding.

Title: Tight spans, Isbell completions and semi-tropical modules
Authors: Simon Willerton
Abstract: In this paper we consider generalized metric spaces in the sense of Lawvere and the categorical Isbell completion construction. We show that this is an analogue of the tight span construction of classical metric spaces, and that the Isbell completion coincides with the directed tight span of Hirai and Koichi. The notions of categorical completion and cocompletion are related to the existence of semi-tropical module structure, and it is shown that the Isbell completion (hence the directed tight span) has two different semi-tropical module structures.

Title: The algebra of the nerves of omega-categories
Authors: Richard Steiner
Abstract: We show that the nerve of a strict omega-category can be described algebraically as a simplicial set with additional operations subject to certain identities. The resulting structures are called sets with complicial identities. We also construct an equivalence between the categories of strict omega-categories and of sets with complical identities.

Title: Complicial structures in the nerves of omega-categories
Authors: Richard Steiner
Abstract: It is known that strict omega-categories are equivalent through the nerve functor to complicial sets and to sets with complicial identities. It follows that complicial sets are equivalent to sets with complicial identities. We discuss these equivalences. In particular we give a conceptual proof that the nerves of omega-categories are complicial sets, and a direct proof that complicial sets are sets with complicial identities.

Title: Multitensor lifting and strictly unital higher category theory
Authors: Michael Batanin, Denis-Charles Cisinski, Mark Weber
Abstract: In this article we extend the theory of lax monoidal structures, also known as multitensors, and the monads on categories of enriched graphs that they give rise to. Our first principal result - the lifting theorem for multitensors - enables us to see the Gray tensor product of 2-categories and the Crans tensor product of Gray categories as part of this framework. We define weak $n$-categories with strict units by means of a notion of reduced higher operad, using the theory of algebraic weak factorisation systems. Our second principal result is to establish a lax tensor product on the category of weak $n$-categories with strict units, so that enriched categories with respect to this tensor product are exactly weak (n+1)-categories with strict units.

Title: Multitensors as monads on categories of enriched graphs
Authors: Mark Weber
Abstract: In this paper we unify the developments of Batanin [1998], Batanin-Weber [2011] and Cheng [2011] into a single framework in which the interplay between multitensors on a category $V$, and monads on the category $\cal G V$ of graphs enriched in $V$, is taken as fundamental. The material presented here is the conceptual background for subsequent work: in Batanin-Cisinski-Weber [2013] the Gray tensor product of 2-categories and the Crans [1999] tensor product of Gray categories are exhibited as existing within our framework, and in Weber [2013] the explicit construction of the funny tensor product of categories is generalised to a large class of Batanin operads.

Title: On theories of superalgebras of differentiable functions
Authors: David Carchedi, Dmitry Roytenberg
Abstract: This is the first in a series of papers laying the foundations for a differential graded approach to derived differential geometry (and other geometries in characteristic zero). In this paper, we study theories of supercommutative algebras for which infinitely differentiable functions can be evaluated on elements. Such a theory is called a <i>super Fermat theory.</i> Any category of superspaces and smooth functions has an associated such theory. This includes both real and complex supermanifolds, as well as algebraic superschemes. In particular, there is a super Fermat theory of <i>$C^\infty$-superalgebras.</i> $C^\infty$-superalgebras are the appropriate notion of supercommutative algebras in the world of $C^\infty$-rings, the latter being of central importance both to synthetic differential geometry and to all existing models of derived smooth manifolds. A super Fermat theory is a natural generalization of the concept of a Fermat theory introduced by E. Dubuc and A. Kock. We show that any Fermat theory admits a canonical <i>superization,</i> however not every super Fermat theory arises in this way. For a fixed super Fermat theory, we go on to study a special subcategory of algebras called near-point determined algebras, and derive many of their algebraic properties.

Title: Tannaka--Krein duality for compact quantum homogeneous spaces. I. General theory
Authors: Kenny De Commer, Makoto Yamashita
Abstract: An ergodic action of a compact quantum group $G$ on an operator algebra $A$ can be interpreted as a quantum homogeneous space for $G$. Such an action gives rise to the category of finite equivariant Hilbert modules over $A$, which has a module structure over the tensor category $Rep(G)$ of finite-dimensional representations of $G$. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the quantum $G$-homogeneous spaces up to equivariant Morita equivalence, and indecomposable module $C^*$-categories over $Rep(G)$ up to natural equivalence. This gives a global approach to the duality theory for ergodic actions as developed by C. Pinzari and J. Roberts.

Title: The Gleason cover of a realizability topos
Authors: Peter Johnstone
Abstract: Recently Benno~van~den~Berg introduced a new class of realizability toposes which he christened Herbrand toposes. These toposes have strikingly different properties from ordinary realizability toposes, notably the (related) properties that the `constant object' functor from the topos of sets preserves finite coproducts, and that De Morgan's law is satisfied. In this paper we show that these properties are no accident: for any Schonfinkel algebra $\Lambda$, the Herbrand realizability topos over $\Lambda$ may be obtained as the Gleason cover (in the sense of Johnstone (1980)) of the ordinary realizability topos over $\Lambda$. As a corollary, we obtain the functoriality of the Herbrand realizability construction on the category of Schonfinkel algebras and computationally dense applicative morphisms.

Title: Some stability properties of epimorphism classes
Authors: Dali Zangurashvili
Abstract: It is proved that in any pointed category with pullbacks, coequalizers and regular epi-mono factorizations, the class of regular epimorphisms is stable under pullback along the so-called balanced effective descent morphisms. Here ``balanced'' can be omitted if the category is additive. A balanced effective descent morphism is defined as an effective descent morphism $p:E\rightarrow B$ such that any subobject of $E$ is a pullback of some morphism along $p$. It is shown that, in any category with pullbacks and coequalizers, the class of effective descent morphisms is stable under pushout if and only if any regular epimorphism is an effective descent morphism. Moreover, it is shown that the class of descent morphisms is stable under pushout if and only if the class of regular epimorphisms is stable under pullback.

Title: Towards a homotopy theory of higher dimensional transition systems
Authors: Philippe Gaucher
Abstract: We proved in a previous work that Cattani-Sassone's higher dimensional transition systems can be interpreted as a small-orthogonality class of a topological locally finitely presentable category of weak higher dimensional transition systems. In this paper, we turn our attention to the full subcategory of weak higher dimensional transition systems which are unions of cubes. It is proved that there exists a left proper combinatorial model structure such that two objects are weakly equivalent if and only if they have the same cubes after simplification of the labelling. This model structure is obtained by Bousfield localizing a model structure which is left determined with respect to a class of maps which is not the class of monomorphisms. We prove that the higher dimensional transition systems corresponding to two process algebras are weakly equivalent if and only if they are isomorphic. We also construct a second Bousfield localization in which two bisimilar cubical transition systems are weakly equivalent. The appendix contains a technical lemma about smallness of weak factorization systems in coreflective subcategories which can be of independent interest. This paper is a first step towards a homotopical interpretation of bisimulation for higher dimensional transition systems.

Abstract: In an earlier work, we constructed the almost strict Morse n-category $\mathcal X$ which extends Cohen and Jones and Segal's flow category. In this article, we define two other almost strict n-categories $\mathcal V$ and $\mathcal W$ where $\mathcal V$ is based on homomorphisms between real vector spaces and $\mathcal W$ consists of tuples of positive integers. The Morse index and the dimension of the Morse moduli spaces give rise to almost strict n-category functors $\mathcal F : \mathcal X \to \mathcal V$ and $\mathcal G : \mathcal X \to \mathcal W$.

Authors: Ryan Cohen Reich
Abstract: We prove that a large class of natural transformations (consisting roughly of those constructed via composition from the ``functorial'' or ``base change'' transformations) between two functors of the form $... f^* g_* ...$ actually has only one element, and thus that any diagram of such maps necessarily commutes. We identify the precise axioms defining what we call a ``geofibered category'' that ensure that such a coherence theorem exists. Our results apply to all the usual sheaf-theoretic contexts of algebraic geometry. The analogous result that would include any other of the six functors remains unknown.

Abstract: We define the analytic spectrum of a rig category $(A,\oplus,\otimes)$, and equip it with a sheaf of categories of rational functions. If the category is additive, we define a sheaf of categories of analytic functions. We relate this construction to Berkovich's analytic spaces, to Durov's generalized schemes and to Haran's F-schemes. We use these relations to define analytic versions of Arakelov compactifications of affine arithmetic varieties.

Title: The theory and practice of Reedy categories
Authors: Emily Riehl, Dominic Verity
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to demystify the role played by the Reedy category axioms in homotopy theory. With no assumed prerequisites beyond a healthy appetite for category theoretic arguments, we present streamlined proofs of a number of useful technical results, which are well known to folklore but difficult to find in the literature. While the results presented here are not new, our approach to their proofs is somewhat novel. Specifically, we reduce much of the hard work involved to simpler computations involving <i>weighted colimits</i> and <i>Leibniz (pushout-product) constructions</i>. The general theory is developed in parallel with examples, which we use to prove that familiar formulae for homotopy limits and colimits indeed have the desired properties.

Title: On the infinity category of homotopy Leibniz algebras
Authors: David Khudaverdyan, Norbert Poncin, Jian Qiu
Abstract: We discuss various concepts of $\infty$-homotopies, as well as the relations between them (focussing on the Leibniz type). In particular $\infty$-$n$-homotopies appear as the $n$-simplices of the nerve of a complete Lie ${\infty}$-algebra. In the nilpotent case, this nerve is known to be a Kan complex. We argue that there is a quasi-category of $\infty$-algebras and show that for truncated $\infty$-algebras, i.e. categorified algebras, this $\infty$-categorical structure projects to a strict 2-categorical one. The paper contains a shortcut to $(\infty,1)$-categories, as well as a review of Getzler's proof of the Kan property. We make the latter concrete by applying it to the 2-term $\infty$-algebra case, thus recovering the concept of homotopy of Baez and Crans, as well as the corresponding composition rule \cite{SS07}. We also answer a question of Shoikhet about composition of $\infty$-homotopies of $\infty$-algebras.

Abstract: We introduce a category that represents varying risk as well as ambiguity. We give a generalized conditional expectation as a presheaf for this category, which not only works as a traditional conditional expectation given a $\sigma$-field but also is compatible with change of measure. Then, we reformulate dynamic monetary value measures as a presheaf for the category. We show how some axioms of dynamic monetary value measures in the classical setting are deduced as theorems in the new formulation, which is evidence that the axioms are correct. Finally, we point out the possibility of giving a theoretical criteria with which we can pick up appropriate sets of axioms required for monetary value measures to be good, using a topology-as-axioms paradigm.

Title: Topological functors as total categories
Authors: Richard Garner
Abstract: A notion of central importance in categorical topology is that of topological functor. A faithful functor $\cal E \to \cal B$ is called topological if it admits cartesian liftings of all (possibly large) families of arrows; the basic example is the forgetful functor $Top \to Set$. A topological functor $\cal E \to 1$ is the same thing as a (large) complete preorder, and the general topological functor $\cal E \to \cal B$ is intuitively thought of as a "complete preorder relative to $\cal B$". We make this intuition precise by considering an enrichment base $\cal Q_\cal B$ such that $\cal Q_\cal B$-enriched categories are faithful functors into $\cal B$, and show that, in this context, a faithful functor is topological if and only if it is total (=totally cocomplete) in the sense of Street-Walters. We also consider the MacNeille completion of a faithful functor to a topological one, first described by Herrlich, and show that it may be obtained as an instance of Isbell's generalised notion of MacNeille completion for enriched categories.

Title: A Bayesian characterization of relative entropy
Authors: John C. Baez, Tobias Fritz
Abstract: We give a new characterization of relative entropy, also known as the Kullback--Leibler divergence. We use a number of interesting categories related to probability theory. In particular, we consider a category FinStat where an object is a finite set equipped with a probability distribution, while a morphism is a measure-preserving function $f \maps X \to Y$ together with a stochastic right inverse $s \maps Y \to X$. The function $f$ can be thought of as a measurement process, while $s$ provides a hypothesis about the state of the measured system given the result of a measurement. Given this data we can define the entropy of the probability distribution on $X$ relative to the `prior' given by pushing the probability distribution on $Y$ forwards along $s$. We say that $s$ is `optimal' if these distributions agree. We show that any convex linear, lower semicontinuous functor from FinStat to the additive monoid $[0,\infty]$ which vanishes when $s$ is optimal must be a scalar multiple of this relative entropy. Our proof is independent of all earlier characterizations, but inspired by the work of Petz.

Authors: Benno van den Berg, Chris Heunen
Abstract: Any functor from the category of C*-algebras to the category of locales that assigns to each commutative C*-algebra its Gelfand spectrum must be trivial on algebras of $n$-by-$n$ matrices for $n \geq 3$. This obstruction also applies to other spectra such as those named after Zariski, Stone, and Pierce. We extend these no-go results to functors with values in (ringed) topological spaces, (ringed) toposes, schemes, and quantales. The possibility of spectra in other categories is discussed.

Abstract: In a paper of 1974, Brian Day employed a notion of factorization system in the context of enriched category theory, replacing the usual diagonal lifting property with a corresponding criterion phrased in terms of hom-objects. We set forth the basic theory of such enriched factorization systems. In particular, we establish stability properties for enriched prefactorization systems, we examine the relation of enriched to ordinary factorization systems, and we provide general results for obtaining enriched factorizations by means of wide (co)intersections. As a special case, we prove results on the existence of enriched factorization systems involving enriched strong monomorphisms or strong epimorphisms.

Title: Continuous cohesion over sets
Authors: Matias Menni
Abstract: A pre-cohesive geometric morphism $p:\cal E \rightarrow \cal S$ satisfies <i>Continuity</i> if the canonical $p_! (X^{p^* S}) \rightarrow (p_! X)^S$ is an iso for every $X$ in $\cal E$ and $S$ in $\cal S$. We show that if $\cal S = Set$ and $\cal E$ is a presheaf topos then, $p$ satisfies Continuity if and only if it is a quality type. Our proof of this characterization rests on a related result showing that Continuity and Sufficient Cohesion are incompatible for presheaf toposes. This incompatibility raises the question whether Continuity and Sufficient Cohesion are ever compatible for Grothendieck toposes. We show that the answer is positive by building some examples.

Title: On deformations of pasting diagrams, II
Authors: Tej Shrestha, D. N. Yetter
Abstract: We continue the development of the infinitesimal deformation theory of pasting diagrams of $k$-linear categories begun in TAC, Vol 22, #2. In that article the standard result that all obstructions are cocycles was established only for the elementary, composition-free parts of pasting diagrams. In the present work we give a proof for pasting diagrams in general. As tools we use the method developed by Shrestha of simultaneously representing formulas for obstructions, along with the corresponding cocycle and cobounding conditions by suitably labeled polygons, giving a rigorous exposition of the previously heuristic method; and deformations of pasting diagrams in which some cells are required to be deformed trivially.

Title: Realizable homotopy colimits
Authors: Beatriz Rodriguez Gonzalez
Abstract: We show that the composition of a homotopically meaningful `geometric realization' (or simple functor) with the simplicial replacement produces all homotopy colimits and Kan extensions in a relative category which is closed under coproducts. Examples (and its duals) include model categories, $\Delta$-closed classes and other concrete examples such as complexes on (AB4) abelian categories, (filtered) commutative dg algebras and mixed Hodge complexes. The resulting homotopy colimits satisfy the expected properties as cofinality and Fubini, and are moreover colimits in a suitable 2-category of relative categories. Conversely, the existence of homotopy colimits satisfying these properties guarantees that $hocolim_{\Delta^o}$ is a simple functor.

Title: Constructing model categories with prescribed fibrant objects
Authors: Alexandru E. Stanculescu
Abstract: We present a weak form of a recognition principle for Quillen model categories due to J.H. Smith. We use it to put a model category structure on the category of small categories enriched over a suitable monoidal simplicial model category. The proof uses a part of the model structure on small simplicial categories due to J. Bergner. We give an application of the weak form of Smith's result to left Bousfield localizations of categories of monoids in a suitable monoidal model category.

Title: Stacks and sheaves of categories as fibrant objects, I
Authors: Alexandru E. Stanculescu
Abstract: We show that the category of categories fibred over a site is a generalized Quillen model category in which the weak equivalences are the local equivalences and the fibrant objects are the stacks, as they were defined by J. Giraud. The generalized model category restricts to one on the full subcategory whose objects are the categories fibred in groupoids. We show that the category of sheaves of categories is a model category that is Quillen equivalent to the generalized model category for stacks and to the model category for strong stacks due to A. Joyal and M. Tierney.

Title: Bicategorical fibration structures and stacks
Authors: Dorette A. Pronk, Michael A. Warren
Abstract: In this paper we introduce two notions - systems of fibrant objects and fibration structures--- which will allow us to associate to a bicategory $B$ a homotopy bicategory $Ho(B)$ in such a way that $Ho(B)$ is the universal way to add pseudo-inverses to weak equivalences in $B$. Furthermore, $Ho(B)$ is locally small when $B$ is and $Ho(B)$ is a 2-category when $B$ is. We thereby resolve two of the problems with known approaches to bicategorical localization. <p> As an important example, we describe a fibration structure on the 2-category of prestacks on a site and prove that the resulting homotopy bicategory is the 2-category of stacks. We also show how this example can be restricted to obtain algebraic, differentiable and topological (respectively) stacks as homotopy categories of algebraic, differential and topological (respectively) prestacks.

Title: More on geometric morphisms between realizability toposes
Authors: Eric Faber, Jaap van Oosten
Abstract: Geometric morphisms between realizability toposes are studied in terms of morphisms between partial combinatory algebras (pcas). The morphisms inducing geometric morphisms (the <i>computationally dense</i> ones) are seen to be the ones whose `lifts' to a kind of completion have right adjoints. We characterize topos inclusions corresponding to a general form of relative computability. We characterize pcas whose realizability topos admits a geometric morphism to the effective topos.

Title: Completion, closure, and density relative to a monad, with examples in functional analysis and sheaf theory
Authors: Rory B. B. Lucyshyn-Wright
Abstract: Given a monad $T$ on a suitable enriched category $B$ equipped with a proper factorization system $(E,M)$, we define notions of <i>$T$-completion, $T$-closure</i>, and <i>$T$-density</i>. We show that not only the familiar notions of completion, closure, and density in normed vector spaces, but also the notions of sheafification, closure, and density with respect to a Lawvere-Tierney topology, are instances of the given abstract notions. The process of $T$-completion is equally the enriched idempotent monad associated to $T$ (which we call the <i>idempotent core of $T$)</i>, and we show that it exists as soon as every morphism in $B$ factors as a $T$-dense morphism followed by a $T$-closed $M$-embedding. The latter hypothesis is satisfied as soon as $B$ has certain pullbacks as well as wide intersections of $M$-embeddings. Hence the resulting theorem on the existence of the idempotent core of an enriched monad entails Fakir's existence result in the non-enriched case, as well as adjoint functor factorization results of Applegate-Tierney and Day.

Title: Iterated icons
Authors: Eugenia Cheng, Nick Gurski
Abstract: We study the totality of categories weakly enriched in a monoidal bicategory using a notion of enriched icon as 2-cells. We show that when the monoidal bicategory in question is symmetric then this process can be iterated. We show that starting from the symmetric monoidal bicategory <b>Cat</b> and performing the construction twice yields a convenient symmetric monoidal bicategory of partially strict tricategories. We show that restricting to the doubly degenerate ones immediately gives the correct bicategory of `2-tuply monoidal categories' missing from our earlier studies of the Periodic Table. We propose a generalisation to all $k$-tuply monoidal $n$-categories.

Title: On strong homotopy for quasi-schemoids
Authors: Katsuhiko Kuribayashi
Abstract: A quasi-schemoid is a small category with a particular partition of the set of morphisms. We define a homotopy relation on the category of quasi-schemoids and study its fundamental properties. The homotopy set of self-homotopy equivalences on a quasi-schemoid is used as a homotopy invariant in the study. The main theorem enables us to deduce that the homotopy invariant for the quasi-schemoid induced by a finite group is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the given group. %These considerations are the first step to develop homotopy theory for quasi-schemoids.

Authors: Jean-Marie Droz, Inna Zakharevich
Abstract: In the present article we describe constructions of model structures on general bicomplete categories. We are motivated by the following question: given a category C with a suitable subcategory wC, when is there a model structure on C with wC as the subcategory of weak equivalences? We begin exploring this question in the case where wC = F^{-1}(iso D) for some functor F : C --> D. We also prove properness of our constructions under minor assumptions and examine an application to the category of infinite graphs.

Title: Algebraic Kan extensions in double categories
Authors: Seerp Roald Koudenburg
Abstract: We study Kan extensions in three weakenings of the Eilenberg-Moore double category associated to a double monad, that was introduced by Grandis and Paré. To be precise, given a normal oplax double monad T on a double category K, we consider the double categories consisting of pseudo T-algebras, `weak' vertical T-morphisms, horizontal T-morphisms and T-cells, where `weak' means either `lax', `colax' or `pseudo'. Denoting these double categories by Alg_w(T), where w = l, c or ps accordingly, our main result gives, in each of these cases, conditions ensuring that (pointwise) Kan extensions can be lifted along the forgetful double functor Alg_w(T) --> K. As an application we recover and generalise a result by Getzler, on the lifting of pointwise left Kan extensions along symmetric monoidal enriched functors. As an application of Getzler's result we prove, in suitable symmetric monoidal categories, the existence of bicommutative Hopf monoids that are freely generated by cocommutative comonoids.

Abstract: The homotopy theory of higher categorical structures has become a relevant part of the machinery of algebraic topology and algebraic K-theory, and this paper contains contributions to the study of the relationship between Benabou's bicategories and the homotopy types of their classifying spaces. Mainly, we state and prove an extension of Quillen's Theorem B by showing, under reasonable necessary conditions, a bicategory-theoretical interpretation of the homotopy-fibre product of the continuous maps induced on classifying spaces by a diagram of bicategories $A\to B \leftarrow A'$. Applications are given for the study of homotopy pullbacks of monoidal categories and of crossed modules.

Title: Lax formal theory of monads, monoidal approach to bicategorical structures and generalized operads
Authors: Dimitri Chikhladze
Abstract: Generalized operads, also called generalized multicategories and $T$-monoids, are defined as monads within a Kleisli bicategory. With or without emphasizing their monoidal nature, generalized operads have been considered by numerous authors in different contexts, with examples including symmetric multicategories, topological spaces, globular operads and Lawvere theories. In this paper we study functoriality of the Kleisli construction, and correspondingly that of generalized operads. Motivated by this problem we develop a lax version of the formal theory of monads, and study its connection to bicategorical structures.

Title: Normalizers, centralizers and action accessibility
Authors: J. R. A. Gray
Abstract: We give several reformulations of action accessibility in the sense of D. Bourn and G. Janelidze. In particular we prove that a pointed exact protomodular category is action accessible if and only if for each normal monomorphism $\kappa:X\to A$ the normalizer of $< \kappa,\kappa>: X\to A\times A$ exists. This clarifies the connection between normalizers and action accessible categories established in a joint paper of D. Bourn and the author, in which it is proved that for pointed exact protomodular categories the existence of normalizers implies action accessibility. In addition we prove a pointed exact protomodular category with coequalizers is action accessible if centralizers of normal monomorphisms exist, and the normality of unions holds.

Title: Slicing sites and semireplete factorization systems
Authors: Thorsten Palm
Abstract: A factorization system (E, M) on a category A gives rise to the covariant category-valued pseudofunctor P of A sending each object to its slice category over M. This article characterizes the P so obtained as follows: their object images have terminal objects, and they admit bicategorically cartesian liftings, up to equivalence, of slice-category projections. It is clear that, and how, (E, M) can be recovered from such a P. The correspondence thus described is actually the second of three similar ones between certain (E, M) and certain P that the article presents. In the first one the characterization of the P has all ultimately bicategorical ingredients replaced with their categorical analogues. A category A with such a P is precisely what the author has called a `slicing site'. In the article's terms the associated (E, M) are again factorization systems - but the concept conveyed extends the standard one by not obliging isomorphisms to belong to either factor class -, namely those that are `right semireplete' (isomorphisms do belong to M and `left semistrict' (morphisms in M are monic relative to E). The third correspondence subsumes the other two; here the (E, M) are all right-semireplete factorization systems.

The coKleisli category of any monoidal differential category is always a Cartesian differential category.

Thus, it was not obvious how to pass from Cartesian differential categories back to monoidal differential categories.

Title: Reflexivity and dualizability in categorified linear algebra
Authors: Martin Brandenburg, Alexandru Chirvasitu, Theo Johnson-Freyd
Abstract: The "linear dual" of a cocomplete linear category $C$ is the category of all cocontinuous linear functors $C \to Vect$. We study the questions of when a cocomplete linear category is reflexive (equivalent to its double dual) or dualizable (the pairing with its dual comes with a corresponding copairing). Our main results are that the category of comodules for a countable-dimensional coassociative coalgebra is always reflexive, but (without any dimension hypothesis) dualizable if and only if it has enough projectives, which rarely happens. Along the way, we prove that the category $QCoh(X)$ of quasi-coherent sheaves on a stack $X$ is not dualizable if $X$ is the classifying stack of a semisimple algebraic group in positive characteristic or if $X$ is a scheme containing a closed projective subscheme of positive dimension, but is dualizable if $X$ is the quotient of an affine scheme by a virtually linearly reductive group. Finally we prove tensoriality (a type of Tannakian duality) for affine ind-schemes with countable indexing poset.

Title: Categories in control
Authors: John C. Baez, Jason Erbele
Abstract: Control theory uses `signal-flow diagrams' to describe processes where real-valued functions of time are added, multiplied by scalars, differentiated and integrated, duplicated and deleted. These diagrams can be seen as string diagrams for the symmetric monoidal category FinVectk of finite-dimensional vector spaces over the field of rational functions k = R(s), where the variable s acts as differentiation and the monoidal structure is direct sum rather than the usual tensor product of vector spaces. For any field k we give a presentation of FinVectk in terms of the generators used in signal-flow diagrams. A broader class of signal-flow diagrams also includes `caps' and `cups' to model feedback. We show these diagrams can be seen as string diagrams for the symmetric monoidal category FinRelk, where objects are still finite-dimensional vector spaces but the morphisms are linear relations. We also give a presentation for FinRelk. The relations say, among other things, that the 1-dimensional vector space k has two special commutative dagger-Frobenius structures, such that the multiplication and unit of either one and the comultiplication and counit of the other fit together to form a bimonoid. This sort of structure, but with tensor product replacing direct sum, is familiar from the `ZX-calculus' obeyed by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space with two mutually unbiased bases.

Title: Actions in modified categories of interest with application to crossed modules
Authors: Y. Boyaci, J. M. Casas, T. Datuashvili, E. O. Uslu
Abstract: The existence of the split extension classifier of a crossed module in the category of associative algebras is investigated. According to the equivalence of categories $XAss \simeq Cat^1-Ass$ we consider this problem in $Cat^1-Ass$. This category is not a category of interest, it satisfies its all axioms except one. The action theory developed in the category of interest is adapted to the new type of category, which will be called modified category of interest. Applying the results obtained in this direction and the equivalence of categories we find a condition under which there exists the split extension classifier of a crossed module and give the corresponding construction.

Title: Internal choice holds in the discrete part of any cohesive topos satisfying stable connected codiscreteness
Authors: F. W. Lawvere, M. Menni
Abstract: We introduce an apparent strengthening of Sufficient Cohesion that we call Stable Connected Codiscreteness (SCC) and show that if $p: E --> S$ is cohesive and satisfies SCC then the internal axiom of choice holds in $S$. Moreover, in this case, $p^!: S --> E$ is equivalent to the inclusion $E_{\neg\neg} --> E$.

Abstract: We introduce the second cohomology categorical group of a categorical group G with coefficients in a symmetric G-categorical group and we show that it classifies extensions of G with symmetric kernel and a functorial section. Moreover, from an essentially surjective homomorphism of categorical groups we get 2-exact sequences a la Hochschild-Serre connecting the categorical groups of derivations and the first and the second cohomology categorical groups.

Title: Finite categories with pushouts
Authors: D. Tambara
Abstract: Let C be a finite category. For an object X of C one has the hom-functor Hom(-,X) of C to Set. If G is a subgroup of Aut(X), one has the quotient functor Hom(-,X)/G. We show that any finite product of hom-functors of C is a sum of hom-functors if and only if C has pushouts and coequalizers and that any finite product of hom-functors of C is a sum of functors of the form \Hom(-,X)/G if and only if C has pushouts. These are variations of the fact that a finite category has products if and only if it has coproducts.

Title: Reduced smooth stacks?
Authors: Giorgio Trentinaglia
Abstract: An arbitrary Lie groupoid gives rise to a groupoid of germs of local diffeomorphisms over its base manifold, known as its <i>effect</i>. The effect of any bundle of Lie groups is trivial. All quotients of a given Lie groupoid determine the same effect. It is natural to regard the effects of any two Morita equivalent Lie groupoids as being ``equivalent''. In this paper we shall describe a systematic way of comparing the effects of different Lie groupoids. In particular, we shall rigorously define what it means for two arbitrary Lie groupoids to give rise to ``equivalent'' effects. For effective orbifold groupoids, the new notion of equivalence turns out to coincide with the traditional notion of Morita equivalence. Our analysis is relevant to the presentation theory of proper smooth stacks.

Title: Cyclic homology arising from adjunctions
Authors: Niels Kowalzig, Ulrich Kr&auml;hmer, Paul Slevin
Abstract: Given a monad and a comonad, one obtains a distributive law between them from lifts of one through an adjunction for the other. In particular, this yields for any bialgebroid the Yetter-Drinfel'd distributive law between the comonad given by a module coalgebra and the monad given by a comodule algebra. It is this self-dual setting that reproduces the cyclic homology of associative and of Hopf algebras in the monadic framework of B&ouml;hm and Stefan. In fact, their approach generates two duplicial objects and morphisms between them which are mutual inverses if and only if the duplicial objects are cyclic. A 2-categorical perspective on the process of twisting coefficients is provided and the role of the two notions of bimonad studied in the literature is clarified.

Title: Decorated cospans
Authors: Brendan Fong
Abstract: Let $C$ be a category with finite colimits, writing its coproduct +, and let $(D, \otimes)$ be a braided monoidal category. We describe a method of producing a symmetric monoidal category from a lax braided monoidal functor $F : (C,+) \to (D, \otimes)$, and of producing a strong monoidal functor between such categories from a monoidal natural transformation between such functors. The objects of these categories, our so-called `decorated cospan categories', are simply the objects of $C$, while the morphisms are pairs comprising a cospan $X \rightarrow N \leftarrow Y$ in $C$ together with an element $1 \to FN$ in $D$. Moreover, decorated cospan categories are hypergraph categories - each object is equipped with a special commutative Frobenius monoid - and their functors preserve this structure.

Title: Generalized covering space theories
Authors: Jeremy Brazas
Abstract: In this paper, we unify various approaches to generalized covering space theory by introducing a categorical framework in which coverings are defined purely in terms of unique lifting properties. For each category C of path-connected spaces having the unit disk as an object, we construct a category of C-coverings over a given space X that embeds in the category of $\pi_1(X,x_0)$-sets via the usual monodromy action on fibers. When C is extended to its coreflective hull H(C), the resulting category of based H(C)-coverings is complete, has an initial object, and often characterizes more of the subgroup lattice of $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ than traditional covering spaces. We apply our results to three special coreflective subcategories: (1) The category of $\Delta$-coverings employs the convenient category of $\Delta$-generated spaces and is universal in the sense that it contains every other generalized covering category as a subcategory. (2) In the locally path-connected category, we preserve notion of generalized covering due to Fischer and Zastrow and characterize the topology of such coverings using the standard whisker topology. (3) By employing the coreflective hull <b>Fan</b> of the category of all contractible spaces, we characterize the notion of continuous lifting of paths and identify the topology of <b>Fan</b>-coverings as the natural quotient topology inherited from the path space.

Abstract: The purpose of this note is to understand the two out of three property of the model category in terms of the weak factorization systems. We will show that if a category with classes of trivial cofibrations, cofibrations, trivial fibrations, and fibrations is given a simplicial structure similar to that of the simplicial model category, then the full subcategory of cofibrant and fibrant objects has the two out of three property, and we will give a list of necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of the simplicial structure for the associated canonical "weak equivalence class" to have the two out of three property.

Title: A C-system defined by a universe category
Authors: Vladimir Voevodsky
Abstract: This is the third paper in a series. In it we construct a C-system CC(C,p) starting from a category C together with a morphism $p:\tilde{U} \to U$, a choice of pull-back squares based on $p$ for all morphisms to $U$ and a choice of a final object of C. Such a quadruple is called a universe category. We then define universe category functors and construct homomorphisms of C-systems CC(C,p) defined by universe category functors. In the sections before the last section we give, for any C-system CC, three different constructions of pairs ((C,p),H) where (C,p) is a universe category and $H : CC \to CC(C,p)$ is an isomorphism. In the last section we construct for any (set) category C with a choice of a final object and fiber products a C-system and an equivalence between C and the precategory underlying CC.

Title: Intercategories
Authors: Marco Grandis, Robert Par&eacute;
Abstract: We introduce a 3-dimensional categorical structure which we call intercategory. This is a kind of weak triple category with three kinds of arrows, three kinds of 2-dimensional cells and one kind of 3-dimensional cells. In one dimension, the compositions are strictly associative and unitary, whereas in the other two, these laws only hold up to coherent isomorphism. The main feature is that the interchange law between the second and third compositions does not hold, but rather there is a non-invertible comparison cell which satisfies some coherence conditions. We introduce appropriate morphisms of intercategory, of which there are three types, and cells relating these. We show that these fit together to produce a strict triple category of intercategories.

Title: 
Authors: Matan Prasma
Abstract: We define a model category structure on a slice category of simplicial spaces, called the "Segal group action" structure, whose fibrant-cofibrant objects may be viewed as representing spaces $X$ with an action of a fixed Segal group (i.e. a group-like, reduced Segal space). We show that this model structure is Quillen equivalent to the projective model structure on $G$-spaces, $S^BG}$, where $G$ is a simplicial group corresponding to the Segal group. One advantage of this model is that if we start with an ordinary group action $X\in S^BG$ and apply a weakly monoidal functor of spaces $L: S \to S$ (such as localization or completion) on each simplicial degree of its associated Segal group action, we get a new Segal group action of $LG$ on $LX$ which can then be rigidified via the above-mentioned Quillen equivalence.

Authors: J. Adamek, J. Rosicky
Abstract: Are all subcategories of locally finitely presentable categories that are closed under limits and $\lambda$-filtered colimits also locally presentable? For full subcategories the answer is affirmative. Makkai and Pitts proved that in the case $\lambda = \aleph_0$ the answer is affirmative also for all iso-full subcategories, i. e., those containing with every pair of objects all isomorphisms between them. We discuss a possible generalization of this from $\aleph_0$ to an arbitrary $\lambda$.

Title: Gauge invariant surface holonomy and monopoles
Authors: Arthur J. Parzygnat
Abstract: There are few known computable examples of non-abelian surface holonomy. In this paper, we give several examples whose structure 2-groups are covering 2-groups and show that the surface holonomies can be computed via a simple formula in terms of paths of 1-dimensional holonomies inspired by earlier work of Chan Hong-Mo and Tsou Sheung Tsun on magnetic monopoles. As a consequence of our work and that of Schreiber and Waldorf, this formula gives a rigorous meaning to non-abelian magnetic flux for magnetic monopoles. In the process, we discuss gauge covariance of surface holonomies for spheres for any 2-group, therefore generalizing the notion of the reduced group introduced by Schreiber and Waldorf. Using these ideas, we also prove that magnetic monopoles form an abelian group.

Title: Transformation double categories associated to 2-group actions
Authors: Jeffrey C. Morton, Roger Picken
Abstract: Transformation groupoids associated to group actions capture the interplay between global and local symmetries of structures described in set-theoretic terms. This paper examines the analogous situation for structures described in category-theoretic terms, where symmetry is expressed as the action of a 2-group G (equivalently, a categorical group) on a category C. It describes the construction of a transformation groupoid in diagrammatic terms, and considers this construction internal to Cat, the category of categories. The result is a double category C//G which describes the local symmetries of C. We define this and describe some of its structure, with the adjoint action of G on itself as a guiding example.

Title: Proximity biframes and compactifications of completely regular ordered spaces
Authors: Guram Bezhanishvili, Patrick J. Morandi
Abstract: We generalize the concept of a strong inclusion on a biframe to that of a proximity on a biframe, which is related to the concept of a strong bi-inclusion on a frame introduced by Picado and Pultr. We also generalize the concept of a bi-compactification of a biframe to that of a compactification of a biframe, and prove that the poset of compactifications of a biframe L is isomorphic to the poset of proximities on L. As a corollary, we obtain Schauerte's characterization of bi-compactifications of a biframe. In the spatial case this yields Blatter and Seever's characterization of compactifications of completely regular ordered spaces and a characterization of bi-compactifications of completely regular bispaces.

Title: The waves of a total category
Authors: R. J. Wood
Abstract: For any <i>total</i> category $K$, with defining adjunction $\sup \ladj Y : K \rightarrow set^{K^{op}}$, the expression $W(a)(k)= set^{set^{K^{op}}}(K(a,\sup -),[k,-])$, where $[k,-]$ is evaluation at $k$, provides a well-defined functor $W : K \rightarrow \hat{K} = set^{K^{op}}$. Also, there are natural transformations $\beta : W\sup \rightarrow 1_{\hat{K}}$ and $\gamma : \sup W \rightarrow 1_K$ satisfying $\sup\beta =\gamma\sup$ and $\beta W =W\gamma$. A total $K$ is <i>totally distributive</i> if $\sup$ has a left adjoint. We show that $K$ is totally distributive iff $\gamma$ is invertible iff $W \ladj \sup$. The elements of $W(a)(k)$ are called <i>waves from $k$ to $a$.</i> <p> Write $\tilde{K}(k,a)$ for $W(a)(k)$. For any total $K$ there is an associative composition of waves. Composition becomes an arrow $\bullet : \tilde{K}\circ_{K}\tilde{K} \rightarrow \tilde{K}$. Also, there is an augmentation $\tilde{K}(-,-) \rightarrow K(-,-)$ corresponding to a natural $\delta : W \rightarrow Y$ constructed via $\beta$. We show that if $K$ is totally distributive then $\bullet$ is invertible and then $\tilde{K}$ supports an idempotent comonad structure. In fact, $\tilde{K} \circ_{K} \tilde{K} = \tilde{K} \circ_{\tilde{K}} \tilde{K}$ so that $\bullet$ is the coequalizer of $\bullet K$ and $K \bullet$, making $\tilde{K}$ a <i>taxon</i> in the sense of Koslowski. For a small taxon $T$, the category of interpolative modules $iMod(1,T)$ is totally distributive. Here we show, for any totally distributive $K$, that there is an equivalence $K \rightarrow iMod(1,\tilde{K})$.

Title: Operads as polynomial 2-monads
Authors: Mark Weber
Abstract: In this article we give a construction of a polynomial 2-monad from an operad and describe the algebras of the 2-monads which then arise. This construction is different from the standard construction of a monad from an operad in that the algebras of our associated 2-monad are the categorified algebras of the original operad. Moreover it enables us to characterise operads as categorical polynomial monads in a canonical way. This point of view reveals categorical polynomial monads as a unifying environment for operads, Cat-operads and clubs. We recover the standard construction of a monad from an operad in a 2-categorical way from our associated 2-monad as a coidentifier of 2-monads, and understand the algebras of both as weak morphisms of operads into a Cat-operad of categories. Algebras of operads within general symmetric monoidal categories arise from our new associated 2-monad in a canonical way. When the operad is sigma-free, we establish a Quillen equivalence, with respect to the model structures on algebras of 2-monads found by Lack, between the strict algebras of our associated 2-monad, and those of the standard one.

Title: Internal algebra classifiers as codescent objects of crossed internal categories
Authors: Mark Weber
Abstract: Inspired by recent work of Batanin and Berger on the homotopy theory of operads, a general monad-theoretic context for speaking about structures within structures is presented, and the problem of constructing the universal ambient structure containing the prescribed internal structure is studied. Following the work of Lack, these universal objects must be constructed from simplicial objects arising from our monad-theoretic framework, as certain 2-categorical colimits called codescent objects. We isolate the extra structure present on these simplicial objects which enable their codescent objects to be computed. These are the crossed internal categories of the title, and generalise the crossed simplicial groups of Loday and Fiedorowicz. The most general results of this article are concerned with how to compute such codescent objects in 2-categories of internal categories, and on isolating conditions on the monad-theoretic situation which enable these results to apply. Combined with earlier work of the author in which operads are seen as polynomial 2-monads, our results are then applied to the theory of non-symmetric, symmetric and braided operads. In particular, the well-known construction of a PROP from an operad is recovered, as an illustration of our techniques.

Title: Algebras of open dynamical systems on the operad of wiring diagrams
Authors: Dmitry Vagner, David I. Spivak, Eugene Lerman
Abstract: In this paper, we use the language of operads to study open dynamical systems. More specifically, we study the algebraic nature of assembling complex dynamical systems from an interconnection of simpler ones. The syntactic architecture of such interconnections is encoded using the visual language of wiring diagrams. We define the symmetric monoidal category $W$, from which we may construct an operad $OW$, whose objects are black boxes with input and output ports, and whose morphisms are wiring diagrams, thus prescribing the algebraic rules for interconnection. We then define two $W$-algebras} $G$ and $L$, which associate semantic content to the structures in $W$. Respectively, they correspond to general and to linear systems of differential equations, in which an internal state is controlled by inputs and produces outputs. As an example, we use these algebras to formalize the classical problem of systems of tanks interconnected by pipes, and hence make explicit the algebraic relationships among systems at different levels of granularity.

Title: On the 3-representations of groups and the 2-categorical traces
Authors: Wei Wang
Abstract: To 2-categorify the theory of group representations, we introduce the notions of the 3-representation of a group in a strict 3-category and the strict 2-categorical action of a group on a strict 2-category. We also 2-categorify the concept of the trace by introducing the 2-categorical trace of a 1-endomorphism in a strict 3-category. For a 3-representation $\rho$ of a group G and an element f of G, the 2-categorical trace $Tr_2\rho_f$ is a category. Moreover, the centralizer of f in G acts categorically on this 2-categorical trace. We construct the induced strict 2-categorical action of a finite group, and show that the 2-categorical trace $Tr_2$ takes an induced strict 2-categorical action into an induced categorical action of the initia groupoid. As a corollary, we get the 3-character formula of the induced strict 2-categorical action.

Title: The Euler characteristic of an enriched category
Authors: Kazunori Noguchi, Kohei Tanaka
Abstract: We develop the homotopy theory of Euler characteristic (magnitude) of a category enriched in a monoidal model category. If a monoidal model category $V$ is equipped with an Euler characteristic that is compatible with weak equivalences and fibrations in $V$, then our Euler characteristic of $V$-enriched categories is also compatible with weak equivalences and fibrations in the canonical model structure on the category of $V$-enriched categories. In particular, we focus on the case of topological categories; i.e., categories enriched in the category of topological spaces. As its application, we obtain the ordinary Euler characteristic of a cellular stratified space $X$ by computing the Euler characteristic of the face category $C(X)$.

Title: The heart of a combinatorial model category
Authors: Zhen Lin Low
Abstract: We show that every small model category that satisfies certain size conditions can be completed to yield a combinatorial model category, and conversely, every combinatorial model category arises in this way. We will also see that these constructions preserve right properness and compatibility with simplicial enrichment. Along the way, we establish some technical results on the index of accessibility of various constructions on accessible categories, which may be of independent interest.

Title: On the magnitude of a finite dimensional algebra
Authors: Joseph Chuang, Alastair King, Tom Leinster
Abstract: There is a general notion of the magnitude of an enriched category, defined subject to hypotheses. In topological and geometric contexts, magnitude is already known to be closely related to classical invariants such as Euler characteristic and dimension. Here we establish its significance in an algebraic context. Specifically, in the representation theory of an associative algebra $A$, a central role is played by the indecomposable projective $A$-modules, which form a category enriched in vector spaces. We show that the magnitude of that category is a known homological invariant of the algebra: writing $\chi_A$ for the Euler form of $A$ and $S$ for the direct sum of the simple $A$-modules, it is $\chi_A(S,S)$.

Title: Enriched algebraic theories and monads for a system of arities
Authors: Rory B. B. Lucyshyn-Wright
Abstract: Under a minimum of assumptions, we develop in generality the basic theory of universal algebra in a symmetric monoidal closed category $V$ with respect to a specified system of arities $j:J \hookrightarrow V$. Lawvere's notion of <i>algebraic theory</i> generalizes to this context, resulting in the notion of <i>single-sorted $V$-enriched $J$-cotensor theory</i>, or $J$-<i>theory</i> for short. For suitable choices of $V$ and $J$, such $J$-theories include the enriched algebraic theories of Borceux and Day, the enriched Lawvere theories of Power, the equational theories of Linton's 1965 work, and the $V$-theories of Dubuc, which are recovered by taking $J = V$ and correspond to arbitrary $V$-monads on $V$. We identify a modest condition on $j$ that entails that the $V$-category of $T$-algebras exists and is monadic over $V$ for every $J$-theory $T$, even when $T$ is not small and $V$ is neither complete nor cocomplete. We show that $j$ satisfies this condition if and only if $j$ presents $V$ as a free cocompletion of $J$ with respect to the weights for left Kan extensions along $j$, and so we call such systems of arities <i>eleutheric</i>. We show that $J$-theories for an eleutheric system may be equivalently described as (i) monads in a certain one-object bicategory of profunctors on $J$, and (ii) $V$-monads on $V$ satisfying a certain condition. We prove a characterization theorem for the categories of algebras of $J$-theories, considered as $V$-categories $A$ equipped with a specified $V$-functor $A \rightarrow V$.

Title: Relative symmetric monoidal closed categories I: Autoenrichment and change of base
Authors: Rory B. B. Lucyshyn-Wright
Abstract: Symmetric monoidal closed categories may be related to one another not only by the functors between them but also by enrichment of one in another, and it was known to G. M. Kelly in the 1960s that there is a very close connection between these phenomena. In this first part of a two-part series on this subject, we show that the assignment to each symmetric monoidal closed category $V$ its associated $V$-enriched category $underline{V}$ extends to a 2-functor valued in an op-2-fibred 2-category of symmetric monoidal closed categories enriched over various bases. For a fixed $V$, we show that this induces a 2-functorial passage from symmetric monoidal closed categories <i>over</i> $V$ (i.e., equipped with a morphism to $V$) to symmetric monoidal closed $V$-categories over $underline{V}$. As a consequence, we find that the enriched adjunction determined a symmetric monoidal closed adjunction can be obtained by applying a 2-functor and, consequently, is an adjunction in the 2-category of symmetric monoidal closed $V$-categories.

Abstract: For a coherent site we construct a canonically associated enlarged coherent site, such that cohomology of bounded below complexes is preserved by the enlargement. In the topos associated to the enlarged site transfinite compositions of epimorphisms are epimorphisms and a weak analog of the concept of the algebraic closure exists. The construction is a variant of the work of Bhatt and Scholze on the pro-etale topology.

Title: Some insights on bicategories of fractions: representations and compositions of 2-morphisms
Authors: Matteo Tommasini
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the construction of bicategories of fractions originally described by D.~Pronk: given any bicategory $C$ together with a suitable class of morphisms $W$, one can construct a bicategory $C[W^{-1}]$, where all the morphisms of $W$ are turned into internal equivalences, and that is universal with respect to this property. Most of the descriptions leading to this construction were long and heavily based on the axiom of choice. In this paper we considerably simplify the description of the equivalence relation on 2-morphisms and the constructions of associators, vertical and horizontal compositions in $C[W^{-1}]$, thus proving that the axiom of choice is not needed under certain conditions. The simplified description of associators and compositions will also play a crucial role in two forthcoming papers about pseudofunctors and equivalences between bicategories of fractions.

Abstract: For a relative exact homological category (C,E), we define <i>relative points</i> over an arbitrary object in C, and show that they form an exact homological category. In particular, it follows that the full subcategory of nilpotent objects in an exact homological category is an exact homological category. These nilpotent objects are defined with respect to a Birkhoff subcategory in C as defined by T. Everaert and T. Van der Linden. In addition, we introduce <i>relative internal actions</i> and show that, just as in the classical case, there is an equivalence of categories between the category of relative points over an object and the category of relative internal actions for the same object.

Title: Right delocalization of model categories
Authors: Bruce R Corrigan-Salter
Abstract: Model categories have long been a useful tool in homotopy theory, allowing many generalizations of results in topological spaces to other categories. Giving a localization of a model category provides an additional model category structure on the same base category, which alters what objects are being considered equivalent by increasing the class of weak equivalences. In some situations, a model category where the class of weak equivalences is restricted from the original one could be more desirable. In this situation we need the notion of a delocalization. In this paper, right Bousfield delocalization is defined, we provide examples of right Bousfield delocalization as well as an existence theorem. In particular, we show that given two model category structures $\MO$ and $\MT$ we can define an additional model category structure $\MO \cap \MT$ by defining the class of weak equivalences to be the intersection of the $\MO$ and $\MT$ weak equivalences. In addition we consider the model category on diagram categories over a base category (which is endowed with a model category structure) and show that delocalization is often preserved by the diagram model category structure.

We establish a new diagram lemma, that we call snail lemma, removing such a condition.

Our results hold in any pointed regular protomodular category.

Title: Linear structures on locales
Authors: Pedro Resende, Joao Paulo Santos
Abstract: We define a notion of morphism for quotient vector bundles that yields both a category $QVBun$ and a contravariant global sections functor $C:QVBun^{op} \to Vect$ whose restriction to trivial vector bundles with fiber F coincides with the contravariant functor $Top^{op} \to Vect$ of F-valued continuous functions. Based on this we obtain a linear extension of the adjunction between the categories of topological spaces and locales: (i) a linearized topological space is a <i>spectral vector bundle</i>, by which is meant a mildly restricted type of quotient vector bundle; (ii) a <i>linearized locale</i> is a locale $\Delta$ equipped with both a topological vector space A and a $\Delta$-valued <i>support map</i> for the elements of A satisfying a continuity condition relative to the spectrum of $\Delta$ and the lower Vietoris topology on $Sub A$; (iii) we obtain an adjunction between the full subcategory of spectral vector bundles $QVBun_\Sigma$ and the category of linearized locales $LinLoc$, which restricts to an equivalence of categories between sober spectral vector bundles and spatial linearized locales. The spectral vector bundles are classified by a finer topology on $Sub A$, called the open support topology, but there is no notion of universal spectral vector bundle for an arbitrary topological vector space A.

Title: The linearity of traces in monoidal categories and bicategories
Authors: Kate Ponto, Michael Shulman
Abstract: We show that in any symmetric monoidal category, if a weight for colimits is absolute, then the resulting colimit of any diagram of dualizable objects is again dualizable. Moreover, in this case, if an endomorphism of the colimit is induced by an endomorphism of the diagram, then its trace can be calculated as a linear combination of traces on the objects in the diagram. The formal nature of this result makes it easy to generalize to traces in homotopical contexts (using derivators) and traces in bicategories. These generalizations include the familiar additivity of the Euler characteristic and Lefschetz number along cofiber sequences, as well as an analogous result for the Reidemeister trace, but also the orbit-counting theorem for sets with a group action, and a general formula for homotopy colimits over EI-categories.

The unit and counit satisfy the usual ``zig-zag'' identities of a compact closed category only up to natural isomorphism, and the isomorphism is subject to a coherence law. We give several examples of compact closed bicategories, then review previous work. In particular, Day and Street defined compact closed bicategories indirectly via Gray monoids and then appealed to a coherence theorem to extend the concept to bicategories; we restate the definition directly.

Title: Tannaka theory over sup-lattices and descent for topoi
Authors: Eduardo J. Dubuc, Martin Szyld
Abstract: We consider locales B as algebras in the tensor category <i>sl</i> of sup-lattices. We show the equivalence between the Joyal-Tierney descent theorem for open localic surjections q : shB --> E in Galois theory and a Tannakian recognition theorem over <i>sl</i> for the <i>sl</i>-functor Rel (q^*) : Rel(E) --> Rel(shB) \cong (B-Mod)_0 into the <i>sl</i>-category of discrete B-modules. Thus, a new Tannaka recognition theorem is obtained, essentially different from those known so far. This equivalence follows from two independent results. We develop an explicit construction of the localic groupoid G associated by Joyal-Tierney to q, and do an exhaustive comparison with the Deligne Tannakian construction of the Hopf algebroid L associated to Rel(q^*), and show they are isomorphic, that is, L \cong O(G). On the other hand, we show that the <i>sl</i>-category of relations of the classifying topos of any localic groupoid G, is equivalent to the <i>sl</i>-category of L-comodules with discrete subjacent B-module, where L = O(G).}

Title: Compositories and gleaves
Authors: Cecilia Flori, Tobias Fritz
Abstract: Sheaves are objects of a local nature: a global section is determined by how it looks locally. Hence, a sheaf cannot describe mathematical structures which contain global or nonlocal geometric information. To fill this gap, we introduce the theory of ``gleaves'', which are presheaves equipped with an additional ``gluing operation'' of compatible pairs of local sections. This generalizes the <i>conditional product</i> structures of Dawid and Studeny, which correspond to gleaves on distributive lattices. Our examples include the gleaf of metric spaces and the gleaf of joint probability distributions. A result of Johnstone shows that a category of gleaves can have a subobject classifier despite not being cartesian closed.

Title: Monads on dagger categories
Authors: Chris Heunen, Martti Karvonen
Abstract: The theory of monads on categories equipped with a dagger (a contravariant identity-on-objects involutive endofunctor) works best when all structure respects the dagger: the monad and adjunctions should preserve the dagger, and the monad and its algebras should satisfy the so-called Frobenius law. Then any monad resolves as an adjunction, with extremal solutions given by the categories of Kleisli and Frobenius-Eilenberg-Moore algebras, which again have a dagger. We characterize the Frobenius law as a coherence property between dagger and closure, and characterize strong such monads as being induced by Frobenius monoids.

Title: A functorial approach to Dedekind completions and the representation of vector lattices and l-algebras by normal functions
Authors: G. Bezhanishvili, P. J. Morandi, B. Olberding
Abstract: Unlike the uniform completion, the Dedekind completion of a vector lattice is not functorial. In order to repair the lack of functoriality of Dedekind completions, we enrich the signature of vector lattices with a proximity relation, thus arriving at the category <b>pdv</b> of proximity Dedekind vector lattices. We prove that the Dedekind completion induces a functor from the category <b>bav</b> of bounded archimedean vector lattices to <b>pdv</b>, which in fact is an equivalence. We utilize the results of Dilworth to show that every proximity Dedekind vector lattice D is represented as the normal real-valued functions on the compact Hausdorff space associated with D. This yields a contravariant adjunction between <b>pdv</b> and the category <b>KHaus</b> of compact Hausdorff spaces, which restricts to a dual equivalence between <b>KHaus</b> and the proper subcategory of <b>pdv</b> consisting of those proximity Dedekind vector lattices in which the proximity is uniformly closed. We show how to derive the classic Yosida Representation, Kakutani-Krein Duality, Stone-Gelfand-Naimark Duality, and Stone-Nakano Theorem from our approach.

Title: Cosheafification
Authors: Andrei V. Prasolov
Abstract: It is proved that for any small Grothendieck site X, there exists a coreflection (called \emph{cosheafification}) from the category of precosheaves on X with values in a category $K$, to the full subcategory of cosheaves, provided either $K$ or $K^{op}$ is locally presentable. If $K$ is cocomplete, such a coreflection is built explicitly for the (pre)cosheaves with values in the category $Pro(K)$ of pro-objects in $K$. In the case of precosheaves on topological spaces, it is proved that any precosheaf with values in $Pro(K)$ is <i>smooth</i>, i.e. is strongly locally isomorphic to a cosheaf. Constant cosheaves are constructed, and there are established connections with shape theory.

Title: A structure theorem for quasi-Hopf bimodule coalgebras
Authors: Daniel Bulacu
Abstract: Let H be a quasi-Hopf algebra. We show that any H-bimodule coalgebra C for which there exists an H-bimodule coalgebra morphism n : C -> H is isomorphic to what we will call a smash product coalgebra. To this end, we use an explicit monoidal equivalence between the category of two-sided two-cosided Hopf modules over H and the category of left Yetter-Drinfeld modules over H. This categorical method allows also to reobtain the structure theorem for a quasi-Hopf (bi)comodule algebra given by Panaite and Van Oystaeyen, and by Dello et al.

Abstract: We introduce a functor called the simplicial nerve of an $A_\infty$-category defined on the category of $A_\infty$-categories with values in simplicial sets. We show that the nerve of an $A_\infty$-category is an $(\infty,1)$-category in the sense of J. Lurie. This construction generalizes the nerve construction for differential graded categories given by Lurie. We prove that if a differential graded category is pretriangulated in the sense of A.I. Bondal and M. Kapranov then its nerve is a stable $(\infty,1)$-category in the sense of J. Lurie.

In addition, we study a number of constructions on presheaves on C-systems and on universe categories that are used in the proofs of our main results, but are expected to have other applications as well.

Title: Bourn-normal monomorphisms in regular Mal'tsev categories
Authors: Giuseppe Metere
Abstract: Normal monomorphisms in the sense of Bourn describe the equivalence classes of an internal equivalence relation. Although the definition is given in the fairly general setting of a category with finite limits, later investigations on this subject often focus on protomodular settings, where normality becomes a property. This paper clarifies the connections between internal equivalence relations and Bourn-normal monomorphisms in regular Mal'tesv categories with pushouts of split monomorphisms along arbitrary morphisms, whereas a full description is achieved for quasi-pointed regular Mal'tsev categories with pushouts of split monomorphisms along arbitrary morphisms.

Title: Homotopy theory for algebras over polynomial monads
Authors: M. A. Batanin, C. Berger
Abstract: We study the existence and left properness of transferred model structures for ``monoid-like'' objects in monoidal model categories. These include genuine monoids, but also all kinds of operads as for instance symmetric, cyclic, modular, higher operads, properads and PROP's. All these structures can be realised as algebras over polynomial monads. We give a general condition for a polynomial monad which ensures the existence and (relative) left properness of a transferred model structure for its algebras. This condition is of a combinatorial nature and singles out a special class of polynomial monads which we call tame polynomial. Many important monads are shown to be tame polynomial.

Title: Classifying tangent structures using Weil algebras
Authors: Poon Leung
Abstract: At the heart of differential geometry is the construction of the tangent bundle of a manifold. There are various abstractions of this construction, and of particular interest here is that of Tangent Structures. Tangent Structure is defined via giving an underlying category M and a tangent functor T along with a list of natural transformations satisfying a set of axioms, then detailing the behaviour of T in the category End(M). However, this axiomatic definition at first seems somewhat disjoint from other approaches in differential geometry. The aim of this paper is to present a perspective that addresses this issue. More specifically, this paper highlights a very explicit relationship between the axiomatic definition of Tangent Structure and the Weil algebras (which have a well established place in differential geometry).

Authors: Jiri Adamek, Lurdes Sousa
Abstract: Given an order-enriched category, it is known that all its KZ-monadic subcategories can be described by Kan-injectivity with respect to a collection of morphisms. We prove the analogous result for Kan-injectivity with respect to a collection H of commutative squares. A square is called a Kan-injective consequence of H if by adding it to H Kan-injectivity is not changed. We present a sound logic for Kan-injectivity consequences and prove that in ``reasonable" categories (such as $\Pos$ or $\Top_0$) it is also complete for every set H of squares.

Authors: Brandon Coya, Brendan Fong
Abstract: Just as binary relations between sets may be understood as jointly monic spans, so too may equivalence relations on the disjoint union of sets be understood as jointly epic cospans. With the ensuing notion of composition inherited from the pushout of cospans, we call these equivalence relations <i>corelations</i>. We define the category of corelations between finite sets and prove that it is equivalent to the prop for extraspecial commutative Frobenius monoids. Dually, we show that the category of relations is equivalent to the prop for special commutative bimonoids. Throughout, we emphasise how corelations model interconnection.

Title: Monoid-like definitions of cyclic operad
Authors: Jovana Obradovic
Abstract: Guided by the microcosm principle of Baez-Dolan and by the algebraic definitions of operads of Kelly and Fiore, we introduce two ``monoid-like'' definitions of cyclic operads, one for the original, ``exchangable-output'' characterisation of Getzler-Kapranov, and the other for the alternative ``entries-only'' characterisation, both within the category of Joyal's species of structures. Relying on a result of Lamarche on descent for species, we use these "monoid-like" definitions to prove the equivalence between the ``exchangable-output'' and ``entries-only'' points of view on cyclic operads.

Authors: Andreas Maurischat
Abstract: Picard-Vessiot rings are present in many settings like differential Galois theory, difference Galois theory and Galois theory of Artinian simple module algebras. In this article we set up an abstract framework in which we can prove theorems on existence and uniqueness of Picard-Vessiot rings, as well as on Galois groups corresponding to the Picard-Vessiot rings. As the present approach restricts to the categorical properties which all the categories of differential modules resp.~difference modules etc.~share, it gives unified proofs for all these Galois theories (and maybe more general ones).

Title: Epireflective subcategories and formal closure operators
Authors: Mathieu Duckerts-Antoine, Marino Gran, Zurab Janelidze
Abstract: On a category $\mathscr{C}$ with a designated (well-behaved) class $\mathcal{M}$ of monomorphisms, a closure operator in the sense of D.~Dikranjan and E.~Giuli is a pointed endofunctor of $\mathcal{M}$, seen as a full subcategory of the arrow-category $\mathscr{C}^\mathbf{2}$ whose objects are morphisms from the class $\mathcal{M}$, which ``commutes'' with the codomain functor $\mathsf{cod}\colon \mathcal{M}\to \mathscr{C}$. In other words, a closure operator consists of a functor $C\colon \mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{M}$ and a natural transformation $c\colon 1_\mathcal{M}\to C$ such that $\mathsf{cod} \cdot C=C$ and $\mathsf{cod}\cdot c=1_\mathsf{cod}$. In this paper we adapt this notion to the domain functor $\mathsf{dom}\colon \mathcal{E}\to\mathscr{C}$, where $\mathcal{E}$ is a class of epimorphisms in $\mathscr{C}$, and show that such closure operators can be used to classify $\mathcal{E}$-epireflective subcategories of $\mathscr{C}$, provided $\mathcal{E}$ is closed under composition and contains isomorphisms.

Title: Algebraic Databases
Authors: Patrick Schultz, David I. Spivak, Christina Vasilakopoulou, Ryan Wisnesky
Abstract: Databases have been studied category-theoretically for decades. While mathematically elegant, previous categorical models have typically struggled withrepresenting concrete data such as integers or strings. In the present work, we propose an extension of the earlier set-valued functor model, making use of multi-sorted algebraic theories (a.k.a. Lawvere theories) to incorporate concrete data in a principled way. This approach easily handles missing information (null values), and also allows constraints and queries to make use of operations on data, such as multiplication or comparison of numbers, helping to bridge the gap between traditional databases and programming languages. We also show how all of the components of our model - including schemas, instances, change-of-schema functors, and queries fit into a single double categorical structure called a proarrow equipment (a.k.a. framed bicategory).

Title: The two out of three property in ind-categories and a convenient model category of spaces
Authors: Ilan Barnea
Abstract: The author and Tomer Schlank studied a much weaker homotopical structure than a model category, which we called a "weak cofibration category". We showed that a small weak cofibration category induces in a natural way a model category structure on its ind-category, provided the ind-category satisfies a certain two out of three property. The main purpose of this paper is to give sufficient intrinsic conditions on a weak cofibration category for this two out of three property to hold. We consider an application to the category of compact metrizable spaces, and thus obtain a model structure on its ind-category. This model structure is defined on a category that is closely related to a category of topological spaces and has many convenient formal properties. A more general application of these results, to the (opposite) category of separable $C^*$-algebras, appears in a paper by the author, Michael Joachim and Snigdhayan Mahanta.

These four 2-monads therefore admit lax extensions to the category Q-<b>Dist</b> of Q-categories and their distributors. We characterize the corresponding (T,Q)-categories in each of the four cases, leading us to both known and novel categorical structures.

Abstract: We define a Levi category to be a weakly orthogonal category equipped with a suitable length functor and prove two main theorems about them. First, skeletal cancellative Levi categories are precisely the categorical versions of graphs of groups with a given orientation. Second, the universal groupoid of a skeletal cancellative Levi category is the fundamental groupoid of the corresponding graph of groups. These two results can be viewed as a co-ordinate-free refinement of a classical theorem of Philip Higgins.

Title: Biextensions, bimonoidal functors, multilinear functor calculus, and categorical rings
Authors: Ettore Aldrovandi
Abstract: We associate to a bimonoidal functor, i.e. a bifunctor which is monoidal in each variable, a nonabelian version of a biextension. We show that such a biextension satisfies additional triviality conditions which make it a bilinear analog of the kind of spans known as butterflies and, conversely, these data determine a bimonoidal functor. We extend this result to n-variables, and prove that, in a manner analogous to that of butterflies, these multi-extensions can be composed. This is phrased in terms of a multilinear functor calculus in a bicategory. As an application, we study a bimonoidal category or stack, treating the multiplicative structure as a bimonoidal functor with respect to the additive one. In the context of the multilinear functor calculus, we view the bimonoidal structure as an instance of the general notion of pseudo-monoid. We show that when the structure is ring-like, i.e. the pseudo-monoid is a stack whose fibers are categorical rings, we can recover the classification by the third Mac~Lane cohomology of a ring with values in a bimodule.

Abstract: Starting from the observation that through groupoids we can express in a unified way the notions of fundamental system of entourages of a uniform structure on a space X, respectively the system of neighborhoods of the unity of a topological group that determines its topology, we introduce in this paper a notion of G-uniformity for a groupoid G. The topology induced by a G-uniformity turns G into a topological locally transitive groupoid. We also prove a Urysohn type lemma for groupoids and obtain metrization theorems for groupoids unifying in two ways the Alexandroff-Urysohn Theorem and Birkhoff-Kakutani Theorem.

Title: A bicategory of decorated cospans
Authors: Kenny Courser
Abstract: If C is a category with pullbacks then there is a bicategory with the same objects as C, spans as morphisms, and maps of spans as 2-morphisms, as shown by Benabou. Fong has developed a theory of `decorated cospans', which are cospans in C equipped with extra structure. This extra structure arises from a symmetric lax monoidal functor F : C --> D; we use this functor to `decorate' each cospan with apex N in C with an element of F(N). Using a result of Shulman, we show that when C has finite colimits, decorated cospans are morphisms in a symmetric monoidal bicategory. We illustrate our construction with examples from electrical engineering and the theory of chemical reaction networks.

Abstract: For each holomorphic vector bundle we construct a holomorphic bundle 2-gerbe that geometrically represents its second Beilinson-Chern class. Applied to the cotangent bundle, this may be regarded as a higher analogue of the canonical line bundle in complex geometry. Moreover, we exhibit the precise relationship between holomorphic and smooth gerbes. For example, we introduce an Atiyah class for gerbes and prove a Koszul-Malgrange type theorem.

Title: Classifiers for monad morphisms and adjunction morphisms
Authors: Dimitri Zaganidis
Abstract: We provide an explicit model for the free 2-category containing n composable adjunction morphisms, comparable to the Schanuel and Street model for the free adjunction. We can extract from it an explicit model for the free 2-category containing n composable lax monad morphisms. A careful proof is given, which goes through presentations of the hom-categories of our model. We use one of these hom-categories as an indexing category to construct an extended Artin-Mazur codiagonal, whose underlying bisimplicial set has the classical Artin-Mazur codiagonal as its first column.

Title: Free objects over posemigroups in the category PoSgr_v
Authors: Shengwei Han, Changchun Xia, Xiaojuan Gu
Abstract: As we all know, the complete lattice I_D(S) of all D-ideals of a meet-semilattice S is precisely the injective hull of S in the category of meet-semilattices. In this paper, we consider sm-ideals of posemigroups which can be regarded as a generalization of D-ideals of meet-semilattices. Unfortunately, the quantale R(S) of all sm-ideals of a posemigroup S is in general not an injective hull of S. However, R(S) can be seen as a new type of quantale completions of S. Further, we can see that R(S) is also a free object over S in the category PoSgr_v of posemigroups with sm-distributive join homomorphisms.

Title: Combinatorics of past-similarity in higher dimensional transition systems
Authors: Philippe Gaucher
Abstract: The key notion to understand the left determined Olschok model category of star-shaped Cattani-Sassone transition systems is past-similarity. Two states are past-similar if they have homotopic pasts. An object is fibrant if and only if the set of transitions is closed under past-similarity. A map is a weak equivalence if and only if it induces an isomorphism after the identification of all past-similar states. The last part of this paper is a discussion about the link between causality and homotopy.

Title: A Dold-Kan theorem for simplicial Lie algebras
Authors: P. Carrasco, A. M. Cegarra
Abstract: We introduce and study <i>hypercrossed complexes of Lie algebras</i>, that is, non-negatively graded chain complexes of Lie algebras $L=(L_n,\partial_n)$ endowed with an additional structure by means of a suitable set of bilinear maps $L_r\times L_s\rightarrow L_n$. The Moore complex of any simplicial Lie algebra acquires such a structure and, in this way, we prove a Dold-Kan type equivalence between the category of simplicial Lie algebras and the category of hypercrossed complexes of Lie algebras. Several consequences of examining particular classes of hypercrossed complexes of Lie algebras are presented.

Title: Localization of enriched categories and cubical sets
Authors: Tyler Lawson
Abstract: The invertibility hypothesis for a monoidal model category S asks that localizing an S-enriched category with respect to an equivalence results in an weakly equivalent enriched category. This is the most technical among the axioms for S to be an <i>excellent model category</i> in the sense of Lurie, who showed that the category Cat_S of S-enriched categories then has a model structure with characterizable fibrant objects. We use a universal property of cubical sets, as a monoidal model category, to show that the invertibility hypothesis is a consequence of the other axioms.

Title: Coexponentiability and Projectivity: Rigs, Rings, and Quantales
Authors: S. B. Niefield, R. J. Wood
Abstract: We show that a commutative monoid A is coexponentiable in CMon(V) if and only if $-\otimes A : V \to V$ has a left adjoint, when V is a cocomplete symmetric monoidal closed category with finite biproducts and in which every object is a quotient of a free. Using a general characterization of the latter, we show that an algebra over a rig or ring R is coexponentiable if and only if it is finitely generated and projective as an R-module. Omitting the finiteness condition, the same result (and proof) is obtained for algebras over a quantale.

Title: Hopf polyads, Hopf categories and Hopf group monoids viewed as Hopf monads
Authors: Gabriella B&ouml;hm
Abstract: We associate, in a functorial way, a monoidal bicategory Span|V to any monoidal bicategory V. Two examples of this construction are of particular interest: <i>Hopf polyads</i> of Bruguieres can be seen as Hopf monads in Span|Cat while <i>Hopf group monoids</i> in the spirit of Zunino and Turaev in a braided monoidal category V, and <i>Hopf categories</i> of Batista-Caenepeel-Vercruysse over V both turn out to be Hopf monads in Span|V. Hopf group monoids and Hopf categories are Hopf monads on a distinguished type of monoidales fitting the framework of Bohm-Lack. These examples are related by a monoidal pseudofunctor V -> Cat.

Abstract: The theory of derivators enhances and simplifies the theory of triangulated categories. In this article a notion of fibered (multi)derivator is developed, which similarly enhances fibrations of (monoidal) triangulated categories. We present a theory of cohomological as well as homological descent in this language. The main motivation is a descent theory for Grothendieck's six operations.

Authors: Ruian Chen, Igor Kriz, Ales Pultr
Abstract: We define a right Cartan-Eilenberg structure on the category of Kan's combinatorial spectra, and the category of sheaves of such spectra, assuming some conditions. In both structures, we use the geometric concept of homotopy equivalence as the strong equivalence. In the case of sheaves, we use local equivalence as the weak equivalence. This paper is the first step in a larger-scale program of investigating sheaves of spectra from a geometric viewpoint.

Title: Operads and phylogenetic trees
Authors: John C. Baez, Nina Otter
Abstract: We construct an operad Phyl whose operations are the edge-labelled trees used in phylogenetics. This operad is the coproduct of Com, the operad for commutative semigroups, and $[0,\infty)$, the operad with unary operations corresponding to nonnegative real numbers, where composition is addition. We show that there is a homeomorphism between the space of n-ary operations of Phyl and $\T_n\times [0,\infty)^{n+1}$, where $\T_n$ is the space of metric n-trees introduced by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann. Furthermore, we show that the Markov models used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from genome data give coalgebras of Phyl. These always extend to coalgebras of the larger operad Com + $[0,\infty]$, since Markov processes on finite sets converge to an equilibrium as time approaches infinity. We show that for any operad O, its coproduct with $[0,\infty]$ contains the operad W(O) constructed by Boardman and Vogt. To prove these results, we explicitly describe the coproduct of operads in terms of labelled trees.

Authors: Eva Colebunders, Karen Van Opdenbosch
Abstract: In this paper we give an isomorphic description of the category of non-Archimedian approach spaces as a category of lax algebras for the ultrafilter monad and an appropriate quantale. Non-Archimedean approach spaces are characterised as those approach spaces having a tower consisting of topologies. We study topological properties p, for p compactness and Hausdorff separation along with low-separation properties, regularity, normality and extremal disconnectedness and link these properties to the condition that all or some of the level topologies in the tower have p. A compactification technique is developed based on Shanin's method.

In particular, a category C is a Mal'tsev category if and only if every object in C is a Mal'tsev object. We show that for a well-powered regular category C which admits coproducts, the full subcategory of Mal'tsev objects is coreflective in C. We show that the co-Mal'tsev objects in the category of topological spaces and continuous maps are precisely the $R_1$-spaces, and that the co-Mal'tsev objects in the category of metric spaces and short maps are precisely the ultrametric spaces.

Abstract: We give several reformulations of action representability of a category as well as action representability of its category of morphisms. In particular we show that for a semi-abelian category C, its category of morphisms is action representable if and only if the functor from the category of split extensions in C to C, sending a split extension to its kernel, is a prefibration. To obtain these reformulations we show that certain conditions are equivalent for right regular spans of categories.

Abstract: We study a categorical commutator, introduced by Huq, defined for a pair of coterminal morphisms. We show that in a normal unital category C with finite colimits, the normal closure of the regular image of the Huq commutator of a pair of subobjects under an arbitrary morphism is the same as the Huq commutator of their respective regular images. Then we use this property to characterize the Huq commutator as the largest commutator satisfying certain properties.

Abstract: For a topos T, there is a bicategory MonicSp(Csp(T)) whose objects are those of T, morphisms are cospans in T, and 2-morphisms are isomorphism classes of monic spans of cospans in T. Using a result of Shulman, we prove that MonicSp(Csp(T)) is symmetric monoidal, and moreover, that it is compact closed in the sense of Stay. We provide an application which illustrates how to encode double pushout rewrite rules as 2-morphisms inside a compact closed sub-bicategory of MonicSp(Csp(Graph)).

Abstract: We extend to the category of crossed modules of Leibniz algebras the notion of biderivation via the action of a Leibniz algebra. This results into a pair of Leibniz algebras which allow us to construct an object which is the actor under certain circumstances. Additionally, we give a description of an action in the category of crossed modules of Leibniz algebras in terms of equations. Finally, we check that, under the aforementioned conditions, the kernel of the canonical map from a crossed module to its actor coincides with the center and we introduce the notions of crossed module of inner and outer biderivations.

We show that to construct such a model structure it is enough to check some relatively simple conditions.

Title: Contravariance through enrichment
Authors: Michael Shulman
Abstract: We define strict and weak duality involutions on 2-categories, and prove a coherence theorem that every bicategory with a weak duality involution is biequivalent to a 2-category with a strict duality involution. For this purpose we introduce "2-categories with contravariance", a sort of enhanced 2-category with a basic notion of "contravariant morphism", which can be regarded either as generalized multicategories or as enriched categories. This enables a universal characterization of duality involutions using absolute weighted colimits, leading to a conceptual proof of the coherence theorem.

Title: Regular patterns, substitudes, Feynman categories and operads
Authors: Michael Batanin, Joachim Kock, Mark Weber
Abstract: We show that the regular patterns of Getzler (2009) form a 2-category biequivalent to the 2-category of substitudes of Day and Street (2003), and that the Feynman categories of Kaufmann and Ward (2013) form a 2-category biequivalent to the 2-category of coloured operads (with invertible 2-cells). These biequivalences induce equivalences between the corresponding categories of algebras. There are three main ingredients in establishing these biequivalences. The first is a strictification theorem (exploiting Power's General Coherence Result) which allows to reduce to the case where the structure maps are identity-on-objects functors and strict monoidal. Second, we subsume the Getzler and Kaufmann-Ward hereditary axioms into the notion of Guitart exactness, a general condition ensuring compatibility between certain left Kan extensions and a given monad, in this case the free-symmetric-monoidal-category monad. Finally we set up a biadjunction between substitudes and what we call pinned symmetric monoidal categories, from which the results follow as a consequence of the fact that the hereditary map is precisely the counit of this biadjunction.

Title: A construction of certain weak colimits and an exactness property of the 2-category of categories
Authors: Descotte M. E., Dubuc E. J., Szyld M.
Abstract: Given a 2-category $A$, a 2-functor $F : A \to Cat$ and a distinguished 1-subcategory $\Sigma \subset A$ containing all the objects, a $\sigma$-cone for $F$ (with respect to $\Sigma$) is a lax cone such that the structural 2-cells corresponding to the arrows of $\Sigma$ are invertible. The conical $\sigma$-limit} is the universal (up to isomorphism) $\sigma$-cone. The notion of $\sigma$-limit generalizes the well known notions of pseudo and lax limit. We consider the fundamental notion of $\sigma$-filtered pair $(A, \Sigma)$ which generalizes the notion of 2-filtered 2-category. We give an explicit construction of $\sigma$-filtered $\sigma$-colimits of categories, a construction which allows computations with these colimits. We then state and prove a basic exactness property of the 2-category of categories, namely, that $\sigma$-filtered $\sigma$-colimits commute with finite weighted pseudo (or bi) limits. An important corollary of this result is that a $\sigma$-filtered $\sigma$-colimit of exact category valued 2-functors is exact. This corollary is essential in the 2-dimensional theory of flat and pro-representable 2-functors, that we develop elsewhere.

Title: A Brauer-Clifford-Long group for the category of dyslectic Hopf Yetter-Drinfel'd (S,H)-module algebras
Authors: Thomas Guedenon, Allen Herman
Abstract: Brauer-Clifford groups are equivariant Brauer groups for which a Hopf algebra acts or coacts nontrivially on the base ring. Brauer-Clifford groups have been established previously in the category of modules for a skew group ring S#G, the category of modules for the smash product S#H over a cocommutative Hopf algebra H, and its dual category of (S,H)-Hopf modules over a commutative Hopf algebra H. In this article the authors introduce a Brauer-Clifford group for the category of dyslectic Hopf Yetter-Drinfel'd (S,H)-modules for an H-commutative base ring S and quantum group H. This is the first such example in a category of modules for a quantum group, and it gives a new example of an equivariant Brauer group in a braided monoidal category.

Authors: Dirk Hofmann, Renato Neves, Pedro Nora
Abstract: It is known since the late 1960's that the dual of the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps is a variety - not finitary, but bounded by $\aleph_1$. In this note we show that the dual of the category of partially ordered compact spaces and monotone continuous maps is an $\aleph_1$-ary quasivariety, and describe partially its algebraic theory. Based on this description, we extend these results to categories of Vietoris coalgebras and homomorphisms on ordered compact spaces. We also characterise the $\aleph_1$-copresentable partially ordered compact spaces.

Title: Pseudo-Kan extensions and descent theory
Authors: Fernando Lucatelli Nunes
Abstract: There are two main constructions in classical descent theory: the category of algebras and the descent category, which are known to be examples of weighted bilimits. We give a formal approach to descent theory, employing formal consequences of commuting properties of bilimits to prove classical and new theorems in the context of Janelidze-Tholen ``Facets of Descent II'', such as Benabou-Roubaud Theorems, a Galois Theorem, embedding results and formal ways of getting effective descent morphisms. In order to do this, we develop the formal part of the theory on commuting bilimits via pseudomonad theory, studying idempotent pseudomonads and proving a 2-dimensional version of the adjoint triangle theorem. Also, we work out the concept of pointwise pseudo-Kan extension, used as a framework to talk about bilimits, commutativity and the descent object. As a subproduct, this formal approach can be an alternative perspective/guiding template for the development of higher descent theory.

Title: Lax pullback complements and pullbacks of spans
Authors: Seyed Naser Hosseini, Walter Tholen, Leila Yeganeh
Abstract: The formation of the "strict" span category Span(C) of a category C with pullbacks is a standard organizational tool of category theory. Unfortunately, limits or colimits in Span(C) are not easily computed in terms of constructions in C. This paper shows how to form the pullback in Span(C) for many, but not all, pairs of spans, given the existence of some specific so-called lax pullback complements in C of the "left legs" of at least one of the two given spans. For some types of spans we require the ambient category to be adhesive to be able to form at least a weak pullback in Span(C). The existence of all lax pullback complements in C along a given morphism is equivalent to the exponentiability of that morphism. Since exponentiability is a rather restrictive property of a morphism, the paper first develops a comprehensive framework of rules for individual lax pullback complement diagrams, which resembles the set of pasting and cancellation rules for pullback diagrams, including their behaviour under pullback. We also present examples of lax pullback complements along non-exponentiable morphisms, obtained via lifting along a fibration.

Title: Double power monad preserving adjunctions are Frobenius
Authors: Christopher Townsend
Abstract: We give a direct proof that between two toposes, F and E, bounded over a base topos S, adjunctions L -| R: Loc_F -> Loc_E over Loc_S are Frobenius if and only if R commutes with the double power locale monad and finite coproducts. The proof uses only certain categorical properties of the category of locales, Loc. This implies that between categories axiomatized to behave like categories of locales, it does not make a difference whether maps are defined as structure preserving adjunctions (i.e. those that commute with the double power monads) or Frobenius adjunctions.

Title: Regularity vs. constructive complete (co)distributivity
Authors: Hongliang Lai, Lili Shen
Abstract: It is well known that a relation $\phi$ between sets is regular if, and only if, $K\phi$ is completely distributive (cd), where $K\phi$ is the complete lattice consisting of fixed points of the Kan adjunction induced by $\phi$. For a small quantaloid Q, we investigate the Q-enriched version of this classical result, i.e., the regularity of Q-distributors versus the constructive complete distributivity (ccd) of Q-categories, and prove that ``the dual of $K\phi$ is (ccd) implies $\phi$ is regular implies $K\phi$ is (ccd)'' for any Q-distributor $\phi$. Although the converse implications do not hold in general, in the case that Q is a commutative integral quantale, we show that these three statements are equivalent for any $\phi$ if, and only if, Q is a Girard quantale.

Title: Higher isotropy
Authors: J. Funk, P. Hofstra, S. Khan
Abstract: This paper is about an invariant of small categories called \emph{isotropy}. Every small category C has associated with it a presheaf of groups on C, called its <i>isotropy group</i>, which in a sense solves the problem of making the assignment C |-> Aut(C) functorial. Consequently, every category has a canonical congruence that annihilates the isotropy; however, it turns out that the resulting quotient may itself have non-trivial isotropy. This phenomenon, which we term <i>higher order isotropy</i>, is the subject of our investigation. We show that with each category C we may associate a sequence of groups called its higher isotropy groups, and that these give rise to a sequence of quotients of C. This sequence leads us to an ordinal invariant for small categories, which we call <i>isotropy rank</i>: the isotropy rank of a small category is the ordinal at which the sequence of quotients stabilizes. Our main results state that each small category has a well-defined isotropy rank, and moreover, that for each small ordinal one may construct a small category with precisely that rank. It happens that isotropy rank of a small category is an instance of the same concept for Grothendieck toposes, for which corresponding statements hold. Most of the technical work in the paper is concerned with the development of tools that allow us to compute (higher) isotropy groups of categories in terms of those of certain suitable subcategories.

Title: Theory of interleavings on categories with a flow
Authors: V. de Silva, E. Munch, A. Stefanou
Abstract: The interleaving distance was originally defined in the field of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) by Chazal et al. as a metric on the class of persistence modules parametrized over the real line. Bubenik et al. subsequently extended the definition to categories of functors on a poset, the objects in these categories being regarded as `generalized persistence modules'. These metrics typically depend on the choice of a lax semigroup of endomorphisms of the poset. The purpose of the present paper is to develop a more general framework for the notion of interleaving distance using the theory of `actegories'. Specifically, we extend the notion of interleaving distance to arbitrary categories equipped with a flow, i.e. a lax monoidal action by the monoid $[0,\infty)$. In this way, the class of objects in such a category acquires the structure of a Lawvere metric space. Functors that are colax $[0,\infty)$-equivariant yield maps that are 1-Lipschitz. This leads to concise proofs of various known stability results from TDA, by considering appropriate colax $[0,\infty)$-equivariant functors. Along the way, we show that several common metrics, including the Hausdorff distance and the $L^\infty$-norm, can be realized as interleaving distances in this general perspective.

Title: Decorated corelations
Authors: Brendan Fong
Abstract: Let $C$ be a category with finite colimits, and let $(E, M)$ be a factorisation system on $C$ with $M$ stable under pushout. Writing $C;M^{\op}$ for the symmetric monoidal category with morphisms cospans of the form $\stackrel{c}\to \stackrel{m}\leftarrow$, where $c \in C$ and $m \in M$, we give a method for constructing a category from a symmetric lax monoidal functor $F : (C; \mc M^{\op},+) \to (Set,\times)$. A morphism in this category, termed a <i>decorated corelation</i>, comprises (i) a cospan $X \to N \leftarrow Y$ in $C$ such that the canonical copairing $X+Y \to N$ lies in $E$, together with (ii) an element of $FN$. Functors between decorated corelation categories can be constructed from natural transformations between the decorating functors $F$. This provides a general method for constructing hypergraph categories - symmetric monoidal categories in which each object is a special commutative Frobenius monoid in a coherent way - and their functors. Such categories are useful for modelling network languages, for example circuit diagrams, and such functors are useful for modelling their semantics.

Title: A parallel section functor for 2-vector bundles
Authors: Christoph Schweigert, Lukas Woike
Abstract: We associate to a 2-vector bundle over an essentially finite groupoid a 2-vector space of parallel sections, or, in representation theoretic terms, of higher invariants, which can be described as homotopy fixed points. Our main result is the extension of this assignment to a symmetric monoidal 2-functor $Par : 2VecBunGrpd \to 2Vect$. It is defined on the symmetric monoidal bicategory $2VecBunGrpd$ whose morphisms arise from spans of groupoids in such a way that the functor $Par$ provides pull-push maps between 2-vector spaces of parallel sections of 2-vector bundles. The direct motivation for our construction comes from the orbifoldization of extended equivariant topological field theories.

Title: Spheres as Frobenius objects
Authors: Djordje Baralic, Zoran Petric, Sonja Telebakovic
Abstract: Following the pattern of the Frobenius structure usually assigned to the 1-dimensional sphere, we investigate the Frobenius structures of spheres in all other dimensions. Starting from dimension d=1, all the spheres are commutative Frobenius objects in categories whose arrows are (d+1)-dimensional cobordisms. With respect to the language of Frobenius objects, there is no distinction between these spheres - they are all free of additional equations formulated in this language. The corresponding structure makes out of the 0-dimensional sphere not a commutative but a symmetric Frobenius object. This sphere is mapped to a matrix Frobenius algebra by a 1-dimensional topological quantum field theory, which corresponds to the representation of a class of diagrammatic algebras given by Richard Brauer.

Title: Props in network theory
Authors: John C. Baez, Brandon Coya, Franciscus Rebro
Abstract: Long before the invention of Feynman diagrams, engineers were using similar diagrams to reason about electrical circuits and more general networks containing mechanical, hydraulic, thermodynamic and chemical components. We can formalize this reasoning using props: that is, strict symmetric monoidal categories where the objects are natural numbers, with the tensor product of objects given by addition. In this approach, each kind of network corresponds to a prop, and each network of this kind is a morphism in that prop. A network with $m$ inputs and $n$ outputs is a morphism from $m$ to $n$, putting networks together in series is composition, and setting them side by side is tensoring. Here we work out the details of this approach for various kinds of electrical circuits, starting with circuits made solely of ideal perfectly conductive wires, then circuits with passive linear components, and then circuits that also have voltage and current sources. Each kind of circuit corresponds to a mathematically natural prop. We describe the `behavior' of these circuits using morphisms between props. In particular, we give a new construction of the black-boxing functor of Fong and the first author; unlike the original construction, this new one easily generalizes to circuits with nonlinear components. We also use a morphism of props to clarify the relation between circuit diagrams and the signal-flow diagrams in control theory. Technically, the key tools are the Rosebrugh-Sabadini-Walters result relating circuits to special commutative Frobenius monoids, the monadic adjunction between props and signatures, and a result saying which symmetric monoidal categories are equivalent to props.

Authors: Darien DeWolf, Dorette Pronk
Abstract: The Ehresmann-Schein-Nambooripad (ESN) Theorem asserts an equivalence between the category of inverse semigroups and the category of inductive groupoids. In this paper, we consider the category of inverse categories and functors - a natural generalization of inverse semigroups and semigroup homomorphisms - and extend the ESN Theorem to an equivalence between this category and the category of locally complete inductive groupoids and locally inductive functors. From the proof of this extension, we also generalize the ESN Theorem to an equivalence between the category of inverse semicategories and the category of locally inductive groupoids and to an equivalence between the category of inverse categories with oplax functors and the category of locally complete inductive groupoids and ordered functors.

Title: On the geometric notion of connection and its expression in tangent categories
Authors: Rory B. B. Lucyshyn-Wright
Abstract: <i>Tangent categories</i> provide an axiomatic approach to key structural aspects of differential geometry that exist not only in the classical category of smooth manifolds but also in algebraic geometry, homological algebra, computer science, and combinatorics. Generalizing the notion of \textit{(linear) connection} on a smooth vector bundle, Cockett and Cruttwell have defined a notion of connection on a differential bundle in an arbitrary tangent category. Herein, we establish equivalent formulations of this notion of connection that reduce the amount of specified structure required. Further, one of our equivalent formulations substantially reduces the number of axioms imposed, and others provide useful abstract conceptualizations of connections. In particular, we show that a connection on a differential bundle $E$ over $M$ is equivalently given by a single morphism $K$ that induces a suitable decomposition of $TE$ as a biproduct. We also show that a connection is equivalently given by a vertical connection $K$ for which a certain associated diagram is a limit diagram.

Title: Crossed products of crossed modules of Hopf monoids
Authors: J. N. Alonso Alvarez, J. M. Fernandez Vilaboa, R. Gonzalez Rodriguez
Abstract: In this paper we consider a crossed product of two crossed modules of Hopf monoids in a strict symmetric monoidal category ${\mathcal C}$ and give necessary and sufficient conditions to get a new crossed module of Hopf monoids in ${\mathcal C}$. Moreover we introduce the notion of projection of crossed modules of Hopf monoids and show that with additional hypotheses, any of these projections defines a new crossed module of Hopf monoids and allows us to construct an example of this kind of crossed product. Finally, we develop the explicit computations of a crossed product associated to a projection of crossed modules in groups.

Title: Coalgebroids in monoidal bicategories and their comodules
Authors: Ramon Abud Alcala
Abstract: Quantum categories have been recently studied because of their relation to bialgebroids, small categories, and skew monoidales. This is the first of a series of papers based on the author's PhD thesis in which we examine the theory of quantum categories developed by Day, Lack, and Street. A quantum category is an opmonoidal monad on the monoidale associated to a biduality $R\dashv R^{o}$, or enveloping monoidale, in a monoidal bicategory of modules $\Mod(V})$ for a monoidal category $V$. Lack and Street proved that quantum categories are in equivalence with right skew monoidales whose unit has a right adjoint in $\Mod(V)$. Our first important result is similar to that of Lack and Street. It is a characterisation of opmonoidal <i>arrows</i> on enveloping monoidales in terms of a new structure named <i>oplax action</i>. We then provide three different notions of comodule for an opmonoidal arrow, and using a similar technique we prove that they are equivalent. Finally, when the opmonoidal arrow is an opmonoidal monad, we are able to provide the category of comodules for a quantum category with a monoidal structure such that the forgetful functor is monoidal.

Title: Tube representations and twisting of graded categories
Authors: 
Abstract: We study deformation of tube algebra under twisting of graded monoidal categories. When a tensor category $C$ is graded over a group $\Gammaa$, a torus-valued 3-cocycle on $\Gammaa$ can be used to deform the associator of $C$. We show that it induces a 2-cocycle on the groupoid of the adjoint action of $\Gammaa$. Combined with the natural Fell bundle structure of tube algebra over this groupoid, we show that the tube algebra of the twisted category is a 2-cocycle twisting of the original one.

Title: $T_0$ topological spaces and $T_0$ posets in the topos of M-sets
Authors: M. M. Ebrahimi, M. Mahmoudi, A. H. Nejah
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of a topological space in the topos M-Set of M-sets, for a monoid M. We do this by replacing the notion of open "subset" by open "subobject" in the definition of a topology. We prove that the resulting category has an open subobject classifier, which is the counterpart of the Sierpinski space in this topos. We also study the relation between the given notion of topology and the notion of a poset in this universe. In fact, the counterpart of the specialization pre-order is given for topological spaces in M-Set, and it is shown that, similar to the classic case, for a special kind of topological spaces in M-Set, namely $T_0$ ones, it is a partial order. Furthermore, we obtain the universal $T_0$ space, and give the adjunction between topological spaces and $T_0$ posets, in M-Set.

Title: A Tangent Category Alternative to the Faa di Bruno Construction
Authors: Jean-Simon P. Lemay
Abstract: The Faa di Bruno construction, introduced by Cockett and Seely, constructs a comonad Faa whose coalgebras are precisely Cartesian differential categories. In other words, for a Cartesian left additive category X, Faa(X) is the cofree Cartesian differential category over X. Composition in these cofree Cartesian differential categories is based on the Faa di Bruno formula, and corresponds to composition of differential forms. This composition, however, is somewhat complex and difficult to work with. In this paper we provide an alternative construction of cofree Cartesian differential categories inspired by tangent categories. In particular, composition defined here is based on the fact that the chain rule for Cartesian differential categories can be expressed using the tangent functor, which simplifies the formulation of the higher order chain rule.

Abstract: We study the structure of the category of polynomials in a locally cartesian closed category. Formalizing the conceptual view that polynomials are constructed from sums and products, we characterize this category in terms of the composite of the pseudomonads which freely add fibred sums and products to fibrations. The composite pseudomonad structure corresponds to a pseudo-distributive law between these two pseudomonads, which exists if and only if the base category is locally cartesian closed.

Title: A compositional framework for passive linear networks
Authors: John C. Baez, Brendan Fong
Abstract: Passive linear networks are used in a wide variety of engineering applications, but the best studied are electrical circuits made of resistors, inductors and capacitors. We describe a category where a morphism is a circuit of this sort with marked input and output terminals. In this category, composition describes the process of attaching the outputs of one circuit to the inputs of another. We construct a functor, dubbed the `black box functor', that takes a circuit, forgets its internal structure, and remembers only its external behavior. Two circuits have the same external behavior if and only if they impose same relation between currents and potentials at their terminals. The space of these currents and potentials naturally has the structure of a symplectic vector space, and the relation imposed by a circuit is a Lagrangian linear relation. Thus, the black box functor goes from our category of circuits to a category with Lagrangian linear relations as morphisms. We prove that this functor is symmetric monoidal and indeed a hypergraph functor. We assume the reader is familiar with category theory, but not with circuit theory or symplectic linear algebra.

Title: Coarse-graining open Markov processes
Authors: John C. Baez, Kenny Courser
Abstract: Coarse-graining is a standard method of extracting a simpler Markov process from a more complicated one by identifying states. Here we extend coarse-graining to `open' Markov processes: that is, those where probability can flow in or out of certain states called `inputs' and `outputs'. One can build up an ordinary Markov process from smaller open pieces in two basic ways: composition, where we identify the outputs of one open Markov process with the inputs of another, and tensoring, where we set two open Markov processes side by side. In previous work, Fong, Pollard and the first author showed that these constructions make open Markov processes into the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category. Here we go further by constructing a symmetric monoidal <i>double</i> category where the 2-morphisms include ways of coarse-graining open Markov processes. We also extend the already known `black-boxing' functor from the category of open Markov processes to our double category. Black-boxing sends any open Markov process to the linear relation between input and output data that holds in steady states, including nonequilibrium steady states where there is a nonzero flow of probability through the process. To extend black-boxing to a functor between double categories, we need to prove that black-boxing is compatible with coarse-graining.

Authors: Remy Tuyeras
Abstract: The present article is the first of a series whose goal is to define a logical formalism in which it is possible to reason about genetics. In this paper, we introduce the main concepts of our language whose domain of discourse consists of a class of limit-sketches and their associated models. While our program will aim to show that different phenomena of genetics can be modeled by changing the category in which the models take their values, in this paper, we study models in the category of sets to capture mutation mechanisms such as insertions, deletions, substitutions, duplications and inversions. We show how the proposed formalism can be used for constructing multiple sequence alignments with an emphasis on mutation mechanisms.

Title: The localic isotropy group of a topos
Authors: Simon Henry
Abstract: It has been shown by J.Funk, P.Hofstra and B.Steinberg that any Grothendieck topos $T$ is endowed with a canonical group object, called its isotropy group, which acts functorially on every object of the topos. We show that this group is in fact the group of points of a localic group object, called the localic isotropy group, which also acts on every object, and in fact also on every internal locale and on every $T$-topos. This new localic isotropy group has better functoriality and stability property than the original version and sheds some light on the phenomenon of higher isotropy observed for the ordinary isotropy group. We prove in particular using a localic version of the isotropy quotient that any geometric morphism can be factored uniquely as a connected atomic geometric morphism followed by a so called ``essentially anisotropic'' geometric morphism, and that connected atomic morphisms are exactly the quotients by open isotropy actions, hence providing a form of Galois theory for general (unpointed) connected atomic geometric morphisms.

Title: Lifting PIE limits with strict projections
Authors: Martin Szyld
Abstract: We give a unified direct proof of the lifting of PIE limits to the 2-category of algebras and (pseudo) morphisms, which specifies precisely which of the projections of the lifted limit are strict and detect strictness. In the literature, these limits were lifted one by one, so as to keep track of these projections in each case. We work in the more general context of weak algebra morphisms, so as to include lax morphisms as well. PIE limits are also all simultaneously lifted in this case, provided some specified arrows of the diagram are pseudo morphisms. Again, this unifies the previously known lifting of many particular PIE limits, which were also treated separately.

Title: Involutive categories, colored *-operads and quantum field theory
Authors: Marco Benini, Alexander Schenkel, Lukas Woike
Abstract: Involutive category theory provides a flexible framework to describe involutive structures on algebraic objects, such as anti-linear involutions on complex vector spaces. Motivated by the prominent role of involutions in quantum (field) theory, we develop the involutive analogs of colored operads and their algebras, named colored *-operads and *-algebras. Central to the definition of colored *-operads is the involutive monoidal category of symmetric sequences, which we obtain from a general product-exponential 2-adjunction whose right adjoint forms involutive functor categories. For *-algebras over *-operads we obtain involutive analogs of the usual change of color and operad adjunctions. As an application, we turn the colored operads for algebraic quantum field theory into colored *-operads. The simplest instance is the associative *-operad, whose *-algebras are unital and associative *-algebras.

We give another definition and prove that they give isomorphic $C$-schemes. This construction gives us a context of non-associative relative algebraic geometry. The most important example of the construction is the octonionic projective space.

Abstract: This is the first part of a series of papers studying the problem of existence of double categories for which horizontal bicategory and object category are given. We refer to this problem as the problem of existence of internalizations for decorated bicategories. Motivated by this we introduce the condition of a double category being globularily generated. We prove that the problem of existence of internalizations for a decorated bicategory admits a solution if and only if it admits a globularily generated solution, and we prove that the condition of a double category being globularily generated is precisely the condition of a solution to the problem of existence of internalizations for a decorated bicategory being minimal in a sense which we will make precise. The study of the condition of a double category being globularily generated will thus be pivotal in our study of the problem of existence of internalizations.

Title: Six operations formalism for generalized operads
Authors: Benjamin C. Ward
Abstract: This paper shows that generalizations of operads equipped with their respective bar/cobar dualities are related by a six operations formalism analogous to that of classical contexts in algebraic geometry. As a consequence of our constructions, we prove intertwining theorems which govern derived Koszul duality of push-forwards and pull-backs.

Title: A probability monad as the colimit of spaces of finite samples
Authors: Tobias Fritz, Paolo Perrone
Abstract: We define and study a probability monad on the category of complete metric spaces and short maps. It assigns to each space the space of Radon probability measures on it with finite first moment, equipped with the Kantorovich-Wasserstein distance. This monad is analogous to the Giry monad on the category of Polish spaces, and it extends a construction due to van Breugel for compact and for 1-bounded complete metric spaces.

Title: Cluster-tilting subcategories in extriangulated categories
Authors: Panyue Zhou, Bin Zhu
Abstract: Let $(C,E,s)$ be an extriangulated category. We show that certain quotient categories of extriangulated categories are equivalent to module categories by some restriction of functor $E$, and in some cases, they are abelian. This result can be regarded as a simultaneous generalization of Koenig-Zhu and Demonet-Liu. In addition, we introduce the notion of maximal rigid subcategories in extriangulated categories. Cluster tilting subcategories are obviously strongly functorially finite maximal rigid subcategories, we prove that the converse is true if the 2-Calabi-Yau extriangulated categories admit a cluster tilting subcategories, which generalizes a result of Buan-Iyama-Reiten-Scott and Zhou-Zhu.

Title: Majority categories
Authors: Michael Anton Hoefnagel
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a majority category - the categorical counterpart of varieties of universal algebras admitting a majority term. This notion can be thought to capture properties of the category of lattices, in a way that parallels how Mal'tsev categories capture properties of the category of groups. Among algebraic majority categories are the categories of lattices, Boolean algebras and Heyting algebras. Many geometric categories such as the category of topological spaces, metric spaces, ordered sets, any topos, etc., are comajority categories (i.e.~their duals are majority categories), and we show that, under mild assumptions, the only categories which are both majority and comajority, are the preorders. Mal'tsev majority categories provide an alternative generalization of arithmetical categories to protoarithmetical categories in the sense of Bourn. We show that every Mal'tsev majority category is protoarithmetical, provide a counter-example for the converse implication, and show that in the Barr-exact context, the converse implication also holds. We can then conclude that a category is arithmetical if and only if it is a Barr-exact Mal'tsev majority category, recovering in the varietal context a well known result of Pixley.

Title: Categorification of pre-Lie Algebras and solutions of 2-graded classical Yang-Baxter equations
Authors: Yunhe Sheng
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of a pre-Lie 2-algebra, which is the categorification of a pre-Lie algebra. We prove that the category of pre-Lie 2-algebras and the category of 2-term pre-Lie$_\infty$-algebras are equivalent. We classify skeletal pre-Lie 2-algebras by the third cohomology group of a pre-Lie algebra. We prove that crossed modules of pre-Lie algebras are in one-to-one correspondence with strict pre-Lie 2-algebras. O-operators on Lie 2-algebras are introduced, which can be used to construct pre-Lie 2-algebras. As an application, we give solutions of 2-graded classical Yang-Baxter equations in some semidirect product Lie 2-algebras.

Title: The formal theory of multimonoidal monads
Authors: Gabriella Bohm
Abstract: Certain aspects of Street's formal theory of monads in 2-categories are extended to multimonoidal monads in symmetric strict monoidal 2-categories. Namely, any symmetric strict monoidal 2-category M admits a symmetric strict monoidal 2-category of pseudomonoids, monoidal 1-cells and monoidal 2-cells in M. Dually, there is a symmetric strict monoidal 2-category of pseudomonoids, opmonoidal 1-cells and opmonoidal 2-cells in M. Extending a construction due to Aguiar and Mahajan for M = Cat, we may apply the first construction p-times and the second one q-times (in any order). It yields a 2-category M_{pq}. A 0-cell therein is an object A of M together with p+q compatible pseudomonoid structures; it is termed a (p+q)-oidal object in M. A monad in M_{pq} is called a (p,q)-oidal monad in M; it is a monad t on A in M together with p monoidal, and q opmonoidal structures in a compatible way. If M has monoidal Eilenberg-Moore construction, and certain (Linton type) stable coequalizers exist, then a (p+q)-oidal structure on the Eilenberg-Moore object A^t of a (p,q)-oidal monad (A,t) is shown to arise via a symmetric strict monoidal double functor to Ehresmann's double category Sqr(M) of squares in M, from the double category of monads in Sqr(M) in the sense of Fiore, Gambino and Kock. While q ones of the pseudomonoid structures of A^t are lifted along the `forgetful' 1-cell A^t -> A, the other p ones are lifted along its left adjoint. In the particular example when M is an appropriate 2-subcategory of Cat, this yields a conceptually different proof of some recent results due to Aguiar, Haim and Lopez Franco.

Abstract: We relate the relative nerve $N_f(D)$ of a diagram of simplicial sets $f : D \to sSet$ with the Grothendieck construction $Gr F$ of a simplicial functor $F : D \to sCat$ in the case where $f = N F$. We further show that any strict monoidal simplicial category $C$ gives rise to a functor $C^\bullet : \Delta^\op \to sCat$, and that the relative nerve of $\N C^\bullet$ is the operadic nerve $\N^\otimes(C)$. Finally, we show that all the above constructions commute with appropriately defined opposite functors.

Title: Well-closed subschemes of noncommutative schemes
Authors: D. Rogalski
Abstract: Van den Bergh has defined the blowup of a noncommutative surface at a point lying on a commutative divisor. We study one aspect of the construction, with an eventual aim of defining more general kinds of noncommutative blowups. Our basic object of study is a quasi-scheme X (a Grothendieck category). Given a closed subcategory Z, in order to define a blowup of X along Z one first needs to have a functor F_Z which is an analog of tensoring with the defining ideal of Z. Following Van den Bergh, a closed subcategory Z which has such a functor is called well-closed. We show that well-closedness can be characterized by the existence of certain projective effacements for each object of X, and that the needed functor F_Z has an explicit description in terms of such effacements. As an application, we prove that closed points are well-closed in quite general quasi-schemes.

Title: Affine geometric spaces in tangent categories
Authors: R. F. Blute, G. S. H. Cruttwell, R. B. B. Lucyshyn-Wright
Abstract: We continue the program of <i>structural differential geometry</i> that begins with the notion of a tangent category, an axiomatization of structural aspects of the tangent functor on the category of smooth manifolds. In classical geometry, having an affine structure on a manifold is equivalent to having a flat torsion-free connection on its tangent bundle. This equivalence allows us to define a category of affine objects associated to a tangent category and we show that the resulting category is also a tangent category, as are several related categories. As a consequence of some of these ideas we also give two new characterizations of flat torsion-free connections. We also consider 2-categorical structure associated to the category of tangent categories and demonstrate that assignment of the tangent category of affine objects to a tangent category induces a 2-comonad.

Title: Colimits of monoids
Authors: Hans-E. Porst
Abstract: If C is a monoidal category with reflexive coequalizers which are preserved by tensoring from both sides, then the category MonC of monoids over C has all coequalizers and these are regular epimorphisms in C. This implies that MonC has all colimits which exist in C, provided that C in addition has (regular epi, jointly monomorphic)-factorizations of discrete cones and admits arbitrary free monoids. A further application is a lifting theorem for adjunctions with a monoidal right adjoint whose left adjoint is not necessarily strong to adjunctions between the respective categories of monoids.

Title: Fibred pseudo double categories for game semantics
Authors: Clovis Eberhart, Tom Hirschowitz
Abstract: We unify previous constructions from our work on concurrent game semantics into a single categorical framework. From an operational description of positions and moves in some game, called a \emph{signature}, we produce a pseudo double category, in which objects are positions and vertical morphisms are plays. The considered games are multi-player, so it makes sense to consider embeddings of positions: these are the horizontal morphisms. Finally, cells may be thought of as embeddings of plays preserving initial and final positions. In order to be suitable for game semantics, the obtained pseudo double category should enjoy a certain fibredness property. Under suitable hypotheses, we show that our construction actually produces such a \emph{fibred} pseudo double category, from which we can define relevant categories of plays, and thus of strategies. We give a first necessary and sufficient criterion for this to hold and then a sufficient criterion that can be checked more easily.

Title: Quotient categories and phases
Authors: Sean Tull
Abstract: We study properties of a category after quotienting out a suitable chosen group of isomorphisms on each object. Coproducts in the original category are described in its quotient by our new weaker notion of a `phased coproduct'. We examine these and show that any suitable category with them arises as such a quotient of a category with coproducts. Motivation comes from projective geometry, and also quantum theory where they describe superpositions in the category of Hilbert spaces and continuous linear maps up to global phase. The quotients we consider also generalise those induced by categorical isotropy in the sense of Funk et al.

Title: Left-invariant vector fields on a Lie 2-group
Authors: Eugene Lerman
Abstract: A Lie 2-group G is a category internal to the category of Lie groups. Consequently it is a monoidal category and a Lie groupoid. The Lie groupoid structure on G gives rise to the Lie 2-algebra X(G) of multiplicative vector fields. The monoidal structure on G gives rise to a left action of the 2-group G on the Lie groupoid G, hence to an action of G on the Lie 2-algebra X(G). As a result we get the Lie 2-algebra X(G)^G of left-invariant multiplicative vector fields.

Title: Coequalizers and free triples, II
Authors: Michael Barr, John Kennison, R. Raphael
Abstract: This paper studies a category X with an endofunctor T : X \to X. A T-algebra is given by a morphism Tx \to x in X. We examine the related questions of when T freely generates a triple (or monad) on X; when an object x in X freely generates a T-algebra; and when the category of T-algebras has coequalizers and other colimits. The paper defines a category of ``T-horns'' which effectively contains X as well as all T-algebras. It is assume that Xs is cocomplete and has a factorization system (E,M) satisfying reasonable properties. An ordinal-indexed sequence of T-horns is then defined which provides successive approximations to a free T-algebra generated by an object x in X, as well as approximations to coequalizers and other colimits for the category of T-algebras. Using the notions of an M-cone and a separated T-horn it is shown that if X is M-well-powered, then the ordinal sequence stabilizes at the desired free algebra or coequalizer or other colimit whenever they exist. This paper is a successor to a paper written by the first author in 1970 that showed that T generates a free triple when every x in X generates a free T-algebra. We also consider colimits in triple algebras and give some examples of functors T for which no x in X generates a free T-algebra.

Title: Monic skeleta, Boundaries, Aufhebung, and the meaning of `one-dimensionality'
Authors: Matias Menni
Abstract: Let E be a topos. If l is a level of E with monic skeleta then it makes sense to consider the objects in E that have <i> l-skeletal boundaries</i>. In particular, if p : E \to S is a pre-cohesive geometric morphism then its centre (that may be called <i>level 0)</i> has monic skeleta. Let <i>level 1</i> be the Aufhebung of level 0. We show that if level 1 has monic skeleta then the quotients of 0-separated objects with 0-skeletal boundaries are 1-skeletal. We also prove that in several examples (such as the classifier of non-trivial Boolean algebras, simplicial sets and the classifier of strictly bipointed objects) every 1-skeletal object is of that form.

Title: The genuine operadic nerve
Authors: Peter Bonventre
Abstract: We construct a generalization of the operadic nerve, providing a translation between the equivariant simplicially enriched operadic world to the parametrized $\infty$-categorical perspective. This naturally factors through genuine equivariant operads, a model for ``equivariant operads with norms up to homotopy''. We introduce the notion of an op-fibration of genuine equivariant operads, extending Grothendieck op-fibrations, and characterize fibrant operads as the image of genuine equivariant symmetric monoidal categories. Moreover, we show that under the operadic nerve, this image is sent to G-symmetric monoidal G-$\infty$-categories. Finally, we produce a functor comparing the notion of algebra over an operad in each of these two contexts.

Title: Weak units, universal cells, and coherence via universality for bicategories
Authors: Amar Hadzihasanovic
Abstract: Poly-bicategories generalise planar polycategories in the same way as bicategories generalise monoidal categories. In a poly-bicategory, the existence of enough 2-cells satisfying certain universal properties (representability) induces coherent algebraic structure on the 2-graph of single-input, single-output 2-cells. A special case of this theory was used by Hermida to produce a proof of strictification for bicategories. No full strictification is possible for higher-dimensional categories, seemingly due to problems with 2-cells that have degenerate boundaries; it was conjectured by C. Simpson that semi-strictification excluding units may be possible.

Title: Biproducts and commutators for noetherian forms
Authors: Francois Koch Van Niekerk
Abstract: Noetherian forms provide an abstract self-dual context in which one can establish homomorphism theorems (Noether isomorphism theorems and homological diagram lemmas) for groups, rings, modules and other group-like structures. In fact, any semi-abelian category in the sense of G. Janelidze, L. M\arki and W. Tholen, as well as any exact category in the sense of M. Grandis (and hence, in particular, any abelian category), can be seen as an example of a noetherian form. In this paper we generalize the notion of a biproduct of objects in an abelian category to a noetherian form and apply it do develop commutator theory in noetherian forms. In the case of semi-abelian categories, biproducts give usual products of objects and our commutators coincide with the so-called Huq commutators (which in the case of groups are the usual commutators of subgroups). This paper thus shows that the structure of a noetherian form allows for a self-dual approach to products and commutators in semi-abelian categories, similarly as has been known for homomorphism theorems.

Title: Adjunction up to automorphism
Authors: D. Tambara
Abstract: We say a set-valued functor on a category is nearly representable if it is a quotient of a representable functor by a group of automorphisms. A distributor is a set-valued functor in two arguments, contravariant in one argument and covariant in the other. We say a distributor is slicewise nearly representable if it is nearly representable in either of the arguments whenever the other argument is fixed. We consider such a distributor a weak analogue of adjunction. Under a finiteness assumption on the domain categories, we show that every slicewise nearly representable functor is a composite of two distributors, each of which may be considered as a weak analogue of (co-)reflective adjunction.

Abstract: An extensive category can be defined as a category C with finite coproducts such that for each pair X,Y of objects in C, the canonical functor $+ : C/X \times C/Y \to C/(X + Y)$ is an equivalence. We say that a category C with finite products is left coextensive if the dual canonical functor $\times : X/C \times Y/C \to (X \times Y)/C$ is fully faithful. We then give a syntactical characterization of left coextensive varieties of universal algebras.

Title: The tangent bundle of a model category
Authors: Yonatan Harpaz, Joost Nuiten, Matan Prasma
Abstract: This paper studies the homotopy theory of parametrized spectrum objects in a model category from a global point of view. More precisely, for a model category $M$ satisfying suitable conditions, we construct a map of model categories $TM \to M$, called the tangent bundle, whose fiber over an object in $M$ is a model category for spectra in its over-category. We show that the tangent bundle is a relative model category and presents the $\infty$-categorical tangent bundle, as constructed by Lurie. Moreover, the tangent bundle $TM$ inherits an enriched model structure from $M$. This additional structure is used in subsequent work to identify the tangent bundles of algebras over an operad and of enriched categories, but may be of independent interest.

Title: On Finitary Functors
Authors: Jiri Adamek, Stefan Milius, Lurdes Sousa, Thorsten Wissmann
Abstract: A simple criterion for a functor to be finitary is presented: we call F finitely bounded if for all objects X every finitely generated subobject of FX factorizes through the F-image of a finitely generated subobject of X. This is equivalent to F being finitary for all functors between `reasonable' locally finitely presentable categories, provided that F preserves monomorphisms. We also discuss the question when that last assumption can be dropped. The answer is affirmative for functors between categories such as Set, K-Vec (vector spaces), boolean algebras, and actions of any finite group either on Set or on K-Vec for fields K of characteristic 0.

Title: A note on internal object action representability of 1-cat groups and crossed modules
Authors: Pako Ramasu
Abstract: The category of 1-cat groups, which is equivalent to the category of crossed modules, has internal object actions which are representable (by internal automorphism groups). Moreover, it is known that the crossed module, corresponding to the representing object [X] = Aut(X) $ associated with a 1-cat group X, must be isomorphic to the Norrie actor of the crossed module corresponding to X. We recall the description of Aut(X) from the author's PhD thesis, and construct that isomorphism explicitly.

Title: The Zassenhaus lemma in star-regular categories
Authors: Olivette Ngaha Ngaha, Florence Sterck
Abstract: The Noether Isomorphism Theorems and the Zassenhaus Lemma from group theory have a non-pointed version in a suitable categorical context first considered by W. Tholen in his PhD thesis. This article leads to a unification of these results with the ones in the pointed categorical context previously considered by O.~Wyler, by working in the framework of \emph{star-regular} categories introduced by M.~Gran, Z.~Janelidze and A.~Ursini. Some concrete examples of categories where these results hold are examined in detail.

Title: A model structure on prederivators for $(\infty,1)$-categories
Authors: D. Fuentes-Keuthan, M. Kedziorek, M. Rovelli
Abstract: By theorems of Carlson and Renaudin, the theory of (&infin;,1)-categories embeds in that of prederivators. The purpose of this paper is to give a two-fold answer to the inverse problem: understanding which prederivators model (&infin;,1)-categories, either strictly or in a homotopical sense. First, we characterize which prederivators arise on the nose as prederivators associated to quasicategories. Next, we put a model structure on the category of prederivators and strict natural transformations, and prove a Quillen equivalence with the Joyal model structure for quasicategories.

Title: A unified framework for notions of algebraic theory
Authors: Soichiro Fujii
Abstract: Universal algebra uniformly captures various algebraic structures, by expressing them as equational theories or abstract clones. The ubiquity of algebraic structures in mathematics and related fields has given rise to several variants of universal algebra, such as theories of symmetric operads, non-symmetric operads, generalised operads, PROPs, PROs, and monads. These variants of universal algebra are called {notions of algebraic theory}. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for them. The key observation is that each notion of algebraic theory can be identified with a monoidal category, in such a way that algebraic theories correspond to monoid objects therein. To incorporate semantics, we introduce a categorical structure called {metamodel}, which formalises a definition of models of algebraic theories. We also define morphisms between notions of algebraic theory, which are a monoidal version of profunctors. Every strong monoidal functor gives rise to an adjoint pair of such morphisms, and provides a uniform method to establish isomorphisms between categories of models in different notions of algebraic theory. A general structure-semantics adjointness result and a double categorical universal property of categories of models are also shown.

Authors: Murray Bremner, Martin Markl
Abstract: By the Three Graces we refer, following J.-L. Loday, to the algebraic operads Ass, Com, and Lie, each generated by a single binary operation; algebras over these operads are respectively associative, commutative associative, and Lie. We classify all distributive laws (in the categorical sense of Beck) between these three operads. Some of our results depend on the computer algebra system Maple, especially its packages <code>LinearAlgebra</code> and <code>Groebner</code>.

Title: Free globularly generated double categories I
Authors: Juan Orendain
Abstract: This is the first part of a two paper series studying free globularly generated double categories. In this first installment we introduce the free globularly generated double category construction. The free globularly generated double category construction canonically associates to every bicategory together with a possible category of vertical morphisms, a double category fixing this set of initial data in a free and minimal way. We use the free globularly generated double category to study length, free products, and problems of internalization. We use the free globularly generated double category construction to provide formal functorial extensions of the Haagerup standard form construction and the Connes fusion operation to inclusions of factors of not-necessarily finite Jones index.

Title: Products and coequalizers in pointed categories
Authors: Michael Hoefnagel
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the property (P) that binary products commute with arbitrary coequalizers in pointed categories. Examples of such categories include any regular unital or (pointed) majority category with coequalizers, as well as any pointed factor permutable category with coequalizers. We establish a Mal'tsev term condition characterizing pointed varieties of universal algebras satisfying (P). We then consider categories satisfying (P) locally, i.e., those categories for which every fibre of the fibration of points satisfies (P). Examples include any regular Mal'tsev or majority category with coequalizers, as well as any regular Gumm category with coequalizers. Varieties satisfying (P) locally are also characterized by a Mal'tsev term condition, which turns out to be equivalent to a variant of Gumm's shifting lemma. Furthermore, we show that the varieties satisfying (P) locally are precisely the varieties with normal local projections in the sense of Z. Janelidze.

Title: The dual of compact ordered spaces is a variety
Authors: Marco Abbadini
Abstract: In a recent paper (2018), D. Hofmann, R. Neves and P. Nora proved that the dual of the category of compact ordered spaces and monotone continuous maps is a quasi-variety -not finitary, but bounded by $\aleph_1$. An open question was: is it also a variety? We show that the answer is affirmative. We describe the variety by means of a set of finitary operations, together with an operation of countably infinite arity, and equational axioms. The dual equivalence is induced by the dualizing object [0,1].

Title: Models of Linear Logic based on the Schwartz $\varepsilon$-product
Authors: Yoann Dabrowski, Marie Kerjean
Abstract: From the interpretation of Linear Logic multiplicative disjunction as the epsilon product defined by Laurent Schwartz, we construct several models of Differential Linear Logic based on the usual mathematical notions of smooth maps. This improves on previous results by Blute, Ehrhard and Tasson based on convenient smoothness where only intuitionist models were built. We isolate a completeness condition, called k-quasi-completeness, and an associated notion which is stable under duality called k-reflexivity, allowing for a star-autonomous category of k-reflexive spaces in which the dual of the tensor product is the reflexive version of the epsilon-product. We adapt Meise's definition of smooth maps into a first model of Differential Linear Logic, made of k-reflexive spaces. We also build two new models of Linear Logic with conveniently smooth maps, on categories made respectively of Mackey-complete Schwartz spaces and Mackey-complete Nuclear Spaces (with extra reflexivity conditions). Varying slightly the notion of smoothness, one also recovers models of DiLL on the same star-autonomous categories. Throughout the article, we work within the setting of Dialogue categories where the tensor product is exactly the epsilon-product (without reflexivization).

Title: Categories of weak fractions
Authors: Pierre-Alain Jacqmin
Abstract: Given a set $\Sigma$ of morphisms in a category C, we construct a functor F which sends elements of $\Sigma$ to split monomorphisms. Moreover, we prove that F is weakly universal with that property when considered in the world of locally posetal 2-categories. Besides, we also use locally posetal 2-categories in order to construct weak left adjoints to those functors for which any object in the codomain admits a weak reflection. We then apply these two results in order to restate the Injective Subcategory Problem for $\Sigma$ into the existence of some kind of weak right adjoint for F.

Title: The word problem for double categories
Authors: Antonin Delpeuch
Abstract: We solve the word problem for free double categories without equations between generators by translating it to the word problem for 2-categories. This yields a quadratic algorithm deciding the equality of diagrams in a free double category. The translation is of interest in its own right since and can for instance be used to reason about double categories with the language of 2-categories, sidestepping the pinwheel problem. It also shows that although double categories are formally more general than 2-categories, they are not actually more expressive, explaining the rarity of applications of this notion.

Title: Braided skew monoidal categories
Authors: John Bourke, Stephen Lack
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a braiding on a skew monoidal category, whose curious feature is that the defining isomorphisms involve three objects rather than two. Examples are shown to arise from 2-category theory and from bialgebras. In order to describe the 2-categorical examples, we take a multicategorical approach. We explain how certain braided skew monoidal structures in the 2-categorical setting give rise to braided monoidal bicategories. For the bialgebraic examples, we show that, for a skew monoidal category arising from a bialgebra, braidings on the skew monoidal category are in bijection with cobraidings (also known as coquasitriangular structures) on the bialgebra.

Moreover, we prove that the two norms agree when X is an oriented compact Riemann surface.

This allows a definition of topological complexity for orbifolds.

Title: A new Galois structure in the category of internal preorders
Authors: Alberto Facchini, Carmelo Finocchiaro, Marino Gran
Abstract: Let PreOrd(C) be the category of internal preorders in an exact category C. We show that the pair (Eq(C),ParOrd(C)) is a pretorsion theory in PreOrd(C), where Eq(C) and ParOrd(C) are the full subcategories of internal equivalence relations and of internal partial orders in C, respectively. We observe that ParOrd(C) is a reflective subcategory of PreOrd(C) such that each component of the unit of the adjunction is a pullback-stable regular epimorphism. The reflector F: PreOrd(C) -> PardOrd(C) turns out to have stable units in the sense of Cassidy, H&eacute;bert and Kelly, thus inducing an admissible categorical Galois structure. In particular, when C is the category Set of sets, we show that this reflection induces a monotone-light factorization system (in the sense of Carboni, Janelidze, Kelly and Par&eacute;) in PreOrd(Set). A topological interpretation of our results in the category of Alexandroff-discrete spaces is also given, via the well-known isomorphism between this latter category and PreOrd(Set).

Authors: Ulrich Bunke, Alexander Engel, Daniel Kasprowski, Christoph Winges
Abstract: We construct combinatorial model category structures on the categories of (marked) categories and (marked) preadditive categories, and we characterize (marked) additive categories as fibrant objects in a Bousfield localization of preadditive categories. These model category structures are used to present the corresponding infinity-categories obtained by inverting equivalences. We apply these results to explicitly calculate limits and colimits in these infinity-categories. The motivating application is a systematic construction of the equivariant coarse algebraic K-homology with coefficients in an additive category from its non-equivariant version.

Title: Orbifolds of Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFTs
Authors: Nils Carqueville, Ingo Runkel, Gregor Schaumann
Abstract: We construct three classes of generalised orbifolds of Reshetikhin-Turaev theory for a modular tensor category C, using the language of defect TQFT: (i) spherical fusion categories give orbifolds for the "trivial" defect TQFT associated to Vect, (ii) G-crossed extensions of C give group orbifolds for any finite group G, and (iii) we construct orbifolds from commutative &Delta;-separable Frobenius algebras in C. We also explain how the Turaev-Viro state sum construction fits into our framework by proving that it is isomorphic to the orbifold of case (i). Moreover, we treat the cases (ii) and (iii) in the more general setting of ribbon tensor categories. For case (ii) we show how Morita equivalence leads to isomorphic orbifolds, and we discuss Tambara-Yamagami categories as particular examples.

Title: Network Models
Authors: John C. Baez, John Foley, Joe Moeller, Blake S. Pollard
Abstract: Networks can be combined in various ways, such as overlaying one on top of another or setting two side by side. We introduce `network models' to encode these ways of combining networks. Different network models describe different kinds of networks. We show that each network model gives rise to an operad, whose operations are ways of assembling a network of the given kind from smaller parts. Such operads, and their algebras, can serve as tools for designing networks. Technically, a network model is a lax symmetric monoidal functor from the free symmetric monoidal category on some set to Cat, and the construction of the corresponding operad proceeds via a symmetric monoidal version of the Grothendieck construction.

Abstract: We prove that the folk model category structure on the category of strict &omega;-categories, introduced by Lafont, Métayer and Worytkiewicz, is monoidal, first, for the Gray tensor product and, second, for the join of &omega;-categories, introduced by the first author and Maltsiniotis. We moreover show that the Gray tensor product induces, by adjunction, a tensor product of strict (m,n)-categories and that this tensor product is also compatible with the folk model category structure. In particular, we get a monoidal model category structure on the category of strict &omega;-groupoids. We prove that this monoidal model category structure satisfies the monoid axiom, so that the category of Gray monoids, studied by the second author, bears a natural model category structure.

Title: A localization of bicategories via homotopies
Authors: Descotte M. E., Dubuc E. J., Szyld M.
Abstract: Given a bicategory C and a family W of arrows of C, we give conditions on the pair (C,W) that allow us to construct the bicategorical localization with respect to W by dealing only with the 2-cells, that is without adding objects or arrows to C. We show that in this case, the 2-cells of the localization can be given by the homotopies with respect to W, a notion defined in this article which is closely related to Quillen's notion of homotopy for model categories but depends only on a single family of arrows. This localization result has a natural application to the construction of the homotopy bicategory of a model bicategory, which we develop elsewhere, as the pair (C_{fc},W) given by the weak equivalences between fibrant-cofibrant objects satisfies the conditions given in the present article.

Title: Weak model categories in classical and constructive mathematics
Authors: Simon Henry
Abstract: We introduce a notion of "weak model category" which is a weakening of the notion of Quillen model category, still sufficient to define a homotopy category, Quillen adjunctions, Quillen equivalences, and most of the usual constructions of categorical homotopy theory. Both left and right semi-model categories are weak model categories, and the opposite of a weak model category is again a weak model category. <p> The main advantage of weak model categories is that they are easier to construct than Quillen model categories. In particular we give some simple criteria on two weak factorization systems for them to form a weak model category. The theory is developed in a very weak constructive, even predicative, framework and we use it to give constructive proofs of the existence of weak versions of various standard model categories, including the Kan-Quillen model structure, Lurie's variant of the Joyal model structure on marked simplicial sets, and the Verity model structure for weak complicial sets. We also construct semi-simplicial versions of all these.

Analogous results for the associated homotopy limit (and other intermediate limits) directly follow.

Abstract: The task of constructing compositional semantics for network-style diagrammatic languages, such as electrical circuits or chemical reaction networks, has been dubbed the black boxing problem, as it gives semantics that describes the properties of each network that can be observed externally, through composition, while discarding the internal structure. One way to solve these problems is to formalise the diagrams and their semantics using hypergraph categories, with semantic interpretation a hypergraph functor, called the black box functor, between them. Building on a previous method for constructing hypergraph categories and functors, known as decorated corelations, in this paper we construct a category of decorating data, and show that the decorated corelations method is itself functorial, with a universal property characterised by a left Kan extension. We then show that any hypergraph category can be presented in terms of decorating data, and hence argue that the category of decorating data is a good setting in which to construct any hypergraph functor. As an example, we give a new construction of Baez and Pollard's black box functor for reaction networks.

Title: Classification of Constructible Cosheaves
Authors: Justin Curry, Amit Patel
Abstract: In this paper we prove an equivalence theorem originally observed by Robert MacPherson. On one side of the equivalence is the category of cosheaves that are constructible with respect to a locally cone-like stratification. Our constructibility condition is new and only requires that certain inclusions of open sets are sent to isomorphisms. On the other side of the equivalence is the category of functors from the entrance path category, which has points for objects and certain homotopy classes of paths for morphisms. When our constructible cosheaves are valued in Set we prove an additional equivalence with the category of stratified coverings.

Title: Cohesive toposes of sheaves on monoids of continuous endofunctions of the unit interval
Authors: Luis Jes&uacute;s Turcio
Abstract: We determine the largest submonoid of the monoid of continuous endomorphisms of the unit interval [0,1] on which the finite partitions form the basis of a Grothendieck topology, and thus determine a cohesive topos over sets. We analyze some of the sheaf theoretic aspects of this topos. Furthermore, we adapt the constructions of Menni to include another model of axiomatic cohesion. We conclude the paper with a proof of the fact that a sufficiently cohesive topos of presheaves does not satisfy the continuity axiom.

Title: On the construction of limits and colimits in $\infty$-categories
Authors: Emily Riehl, Dominic Verity
Abstract: In previous work, we introduce an axiomatic framework within which to prove theorems about many varieties of infinite-dimensional categories simultaneously. In this paper, we establish criteria implying that an &infin;-category --- for instance, a quasi-category, a complete Segal space, or a Segal category --- is complete and cocomplete, admitting limits and colimits indexed by any small simplicial set. Our strategy is to build (co)limits of diagrams indexed by a simplicial set inductively from (co)limits of restricted diagrams indexed by the pieces of its skeletal filtration. We show directly that the modules that express the universal properties of (co)limits of diagrams of these shapes are reconstructible as limits of the modules that express the universal properties of (co)limits of the restricted diagrams. We also prove that the Yoneda embedding preserves and reflects limits in a suitable sense, and deduce our main theorems as a consequence.

Title: Monoidal Grothendieck Construction
Authors: Joe Moeller, Christina Vasilakopoulou
Abstract: We lift the standard equivalence between fibrations and indexed categories to an equivalence between monoidal fibrations and monoidal indexed categories, namely lax monoidal pseudofunctors to the 2-category of categories. Furthermore, we investigate the relation between this `global' monoidal version where the total category is monoidal and the fibration strictly preserves the structure, and a `fibrewise' one where the fibres are monoidal and the reindexing functors strongly preserve the structure, first hinted by Shulman. In particular, when the domain is cocartesian monoidal, we show how lax monoidal structures on a pseudofunctor to Cat bijectively correspond to lifts of the pseudofunctor to MonCat. Finally, we give some examples where this correspondence appears, spanning from the fundamental and family fibrations to network models and systems.

Title: Exponentiability in Double Categories and the Glueing Construction
Authors: Susan Niefield
Abstract: We consider pre-exponentiable objects of a pre-cartesian double category D, i.e., objects Y such that the lax functor - x Y: D --> D has a right adjoint in the 2-category LxDbl of double categories and lax functors. When D has 2-glueing, we show that Y is pre-exponentiable in D if and only if Y is exponentiable in D_0 and - x Y is an oplax functor. Thus, such a D is pre-cartesian closed as a double category if and only if D_0 is a cartesian closed category. Applications include the double categories cat, pos, spaces, loc, and topos, whose objects are small categories, posets, topological space, locales, and toposes, respectively.

Title: Segal enriched categories and applications
Authors: Hugo V. Bacard
Abstract: In this paper we develop a theory of Segal enriched categories. Our motivation was to generalize the notion of up-to-homotopy monoid in a monoidal category, introduced by Leinster. Our formalism generalizes the classical theory of Segal categories and extends the theory of categories enriched over a 2-category. We introduce Segal dg-categories which did not exist so far. We show that the homotopy transfer problem for algebras leads directly to a Leinster-Segal algebra.

Title: Lax Familial Representability and Lax Generic Factorizations
Authors: Charles Walker
Abstract: A classical result due to Diers shows that a copresheaf F: A -> Set on a category A is a coproduct of representables precisely when each connected component of F's category of elements has an initial object. Most often, this condition is imposed on a copresheaf of the form B(X,T-) for a functor T: A -> B, in which case this property says that T admits generic factorizations at X, or equivalently that T is familial at X. <p> Here we generalize these results to the two-dimensional setting, replacing A with an arbitrary bicategory A, and Set with Cat. In this two-dimensional setting, simply asking that a pseudofunctor A -> Cat be a coproduct of representables is often too strong of a condition. Instead, we will only ask that F be a lax conical colimit of representables. This in turn allows for the weaker notion of lax generic factorizations (and lax familial representability) for pseudofunctors of bicategories T: A -> B. <p> We also compare our lax familial pseudofunctors to Weber's familial 2-functors, finding our description is more general (not requiring a terminal object in A), though essentially equivalent when a terminal object does exist. Moreover, our description of lax generics allows for an equivalence between lax generic factorizations and lax familial representability. <p> Finally, we characterize our lax familial pseudofunctors as right lax F-adjoints followed by locally discrete fibrations of bicategories, which in turn yields a simple definition of parametric right adjoint pseudofunctors.

Title: Information structures and their cohomology
Authors: Juan Pablo Vigneaux
Abstract: We introduce the category of information structures, whose objects are suitable diagrams of measurable sets that encode the possible outputs of a given family of observables and their mutual relationships of refinement; they serve as mathematical models of contextuality in classical and quantum settings. Each information structure can be regarded as a ringed site with trivial topology; the structure ring is generated by the observables themselves and its multiplication corresponds to joint measurement. We extend Baudot and Bennequin's definition of information cohomology to this setting, as a derived functor in the category of modules over the structure ring, and show explicitly that the bar construction gives a projective resolution in that category, recovering in this way the cochain complexes previously considered in the literature. Finally, we study the particular case of a one-parameter family of coefficients made of functions of probability distributions. The only 1-cocycles are Shannon entropy or Tsallis alpha-entropy, depending on the value of the parameter.

Title: Internal split opfibrations and cofunctors
Authors: Bryce Clarke
Abstract: Split opfibrations are functors equipped with a suitable choice of opcartesian lifts. The purpose of this paper is to characterise internal split opfibrations through separating the structure of a suitable choice of lifts from the property of these lifts being opcartesian. The underlying structure of an internal split opfibration is captured by an internal functor equipped with an internal cofunctor, while the property may be expressed as a pullback condition, akin to the simple condition on an internal functor to be an internal discrete opfibration. Furthermore, this approach provides two additional characterisations of internal split opfibrations, via the d&eacute;calage construction and strict factorisation systems. For small categories, this theory clarifies several aspects of delta lenses which arise in computer science.

Title: Formal composition of hybrid systems
Authors: Jared Culbertson, Paul Gustafson, Daniel E. Koditschek, Peter F. Stiller
Abstract: We develop a compositional framework for formal synthesis of hybrid systems using the language of category theory. More specifically, we provide mutually compatible tools for hierarchical, sequential, and independent parallel composition. In our framework, hierarchies of hybrid systems correspond to template-anchor pairs, which we model as spans of subdividing and embedding semiconjugacies. Hierarchical composition of template-anchor pairs corresponds to the composition of spans via fiber product. To model sequential composition, we introduce ``directed hybrid systems,'' each of which flows from an initial subsystem to a final subsystem in a Conley-theoretic sense. Sequential composition of directed systems is given by a pushout of graph embeddings, rewriting the continuous dynamics of the overlapping subsystem to prioritize the second directed system. Independent parallel composition corresponds to a categorical product with respect to semiconjugacy. To formalize the compatibility of these three types of composition, we construct a vertically cartesian double category of hybrid systems where the vertical morphisms are semiconjugacies, and the horizontal morphisms are directed hybrid systems.

Abstract: We recall the notions of a graded cocategory, conilpotent cocategory, morphisms of such (cofunctors), coderivations and define their analogs in L-filtered setting. The difference with the existing approaches: we do not impose any restriction on &Lambda;-modules of morphisms (unlike Fukaya and collaborators), we consider a wider class of filtrations than De Deken and Lowen (including directed groups L). Results for completed filtered conilpotent cocategories include: cofunctors and coderivations with value in completed tensor cocategory are described, a partial internal hom is constructed as the tensor cocategory of certain coderivation quiver, when the second argument is a completed tensor cocategory.

Title: Structured cospans
Authors: John C. Baez, Kenny Courser
Abstract: One goal of applied category theory is to better understand networks appearing throughout science and engineering. Here we introduce `structured cospans' as a way to study networks with inputs and outputs. Given a functor L: A -> X, a structured cospan is a diagram in X of the form L(a) -> x <- L(b). If A and X have finite colimits and L is a left adjoint, we obtain a symmetric monoidal category whose objects are those of A and whose morphisms are isomorphism classes of structured cospans. This is a hypergraph category. However, it arises from a more fundamental structure: a symmetric monoidal double category where the horizontal 1-cells are structured cospans. We show how structured cospans solve certain problems in the closely related formalism of `decorated cospans', and explain how they work in some examples: electrical circuits, Petri nets, and chemical reaction networks.

Title: A Categorical Reduction System for Linear Logic
Authors: Ryu Hasegawa
Abstract: Diagram chasing is not an easy task. The coherence holds in a generalized sense if we have a mechanical method to judge whether given two morphisms are equal to each other. A simple way to this end is to reform a concerned category into a calculus, where the instructions for the diagram chasing are given in the form of rewriting rules. We apply this idea to the categorical semantics of the linear logic. We build a calculus directly on the free category of the semantics. It enables us to perform diagram chasing as essentially one-way computations led by the rewriting rules. We verify the weak termination property of this calculus. This gives the first step towards the mechanization of diagram chasing.

Title: Internal partial combinatory algebras and their slices
Authors: Jetze Zoethout
Abstract: A partial combinatory algebra (PCA) is a set equipped with a partial binary operation that models a notion of computability. This paper studies a generalization of PCAs, introduced by W. Stekelenburg, where a PCA is not a set but an object in a given regular category. The corresponding class of categories of assemblies is closed both under taking small products and under slicing, which is to be contrasted with the situation for ordinary PCAs. We describe these two constructions explicitly at the level of PCAs, allowing us to compute a number of examples of products and slices of PCAs. Moreover, we show how PCAs can be transported along regular functors, enabling us to compare PCAs constructed over different base categories. Via a Grothendieck construction, this leads to a (2-)category whose objects are PCAs and whose arrows are generalized applicative morphisms. This category has small products, which correspond to the small products of categories of assemblies, and it has finite coproducts in a weak sense. Finally, we give a criterion when a functor between categories of assemblies that is induced by an applicative morphism has a right adjoint, by generalizing the notion of computational density.

Title: Span composition using fake pullbacks
Authors: Ross Street
Abstract: The construction of a category of spans can be made in some categories A which do not have pullbacks in the traditional sense. The PROP for monoids is a good example of such an A. The 2012 book concerning homological algebra by Marco Grandis gives the proof of associativity of relations in a Puppe-exact category based on a 1967 paper of M.S. Calenko. The proof here is a restructuring of that proof in the spirit of the first sentence of this Abstract. We observe that these relations are spans of EM-spans and that EM-spans admit fake pullbacks so that spans of EM-spans compose. Our setting is more general than Puppe-exact categories. We mention the formalism of distributive laws which, in a generalized form, would cover our setting.

Title: Closed dendroidal sets and unital operads
Authors: Ieke Moerdijk
Abstract: We discuss a variant of the category of dendroidal sets, the so-called closed dendroidal sets which are indexed by trees without leaves. This category carries a Quillen model structure which behaves better than the one on general dendroidal sets, mainly because it satisfies the pushout-product property, hence induces a symmetric monoidal structure on its homotopy category. We also study complete Segal style model structures on closed dendroidal spaces, and various Quillen adjunctions to model categories on (all) dendroidal sets or spaces. As a consequence, we deduce a Quillen equivalence from closed dendroidal sets to the category of unital simplicial operads, as well as to that of simplicial operads which are unital up-to-homotopy. The proofs exhibit several new combinatorial features of categories of closed trees.

Title: The comprehensive factorization of Burroni's T-functors
Authors: Walter Tholen, Leila Yeganeh
Abstract: Expanding on the comprehensive factorization of functors internal to a category C, under fairly mild conditions on a monad T on C we establish that this orthogonal factorization system exists even in Burroni's category Cat(T) of (internal) T-categories and their functors. This context provides for some expected applications and some unexpected connections. For example, it lets us deduce that the comprehensive factorization is also available for functors of Lambek's multicategories.

Title: The canonical intensive quality of a cohesive topos
Authors: F. Marmolejo, M. Menni
Abstract: We strengthen a result of Lawvere by proving that every pre-cohesive geometric morphism p: E --> S has a canonical intensive quality s: E --> L. We also discuss examples among bounded pre-cohesive p: E --> S and, in particular, we show that if E is a presheaf topos then so is L. This result lifts to Grothendieck toposes but the sites obtained need not be subcanonical. To illustrate this phenomenon, and also the subtle passage from E to L, we consider a particular family of bounded cohesive toposes over Set and build subcanonical sites for their associated categories L.

Title: Algebraic exponentiation for Lie algebras
Authors: Xabier Garc&iacute;a-Mart&iacute;nez, James R. A. Gray
Abstract: It is known that the category of Lie algebras over a ring admits algebraic exponents. The aim of this paper is to show that the same is true for the category of internal Lie algebras in an additive, cocomplete, symmetric, closed, monoidal category. In this way, we add some new examples to the brief list of known locally algebraically cartesian closed categories, including the categories of Lie superalgebras and differentially graded Lie algebras amongst others. Note that we are mainly interested in the case where the underlying category is abelian, as is the case in all our examples, but do not impose this condition since not requiring it adds no complexity to our arguments.

Title: Isbell conjugacy and the reflexive completion
Authors: Tom Avery, Tom Leinster
Abstract: The reflexive completion of a category consists of the Set-valued functors on it that are canonically isomorphic to their double conjugate. After reviewing both this construction and Isbell conjugacy itself, we give new examples and revisit Isbell's main results from 1960 in a modern categorical context. We establish the sense in which reflexive completion is functorial, and find conditions under which two categories have equivalent reflexive completions. We describe the relationship between the reflexive and Cauchy completions, determine exactly which limits and colimits exist in an arbitrary reflexive completion, and make precise the sense in which the reflexive completion of a category is the intersection of the categories of covariant and contravariant functors on it.

Title: Extensions and Glueing in Double Categories
Authors: Susan Niefield
Abstract: Let D be a double category with an initial object. Any cotabulator Gamma(v) of a vertical morphism v:X-->Y gives rise to an extension (i.e., short exact sequence) X-->Gamma(v)-->Y in the vertical bicategory VD. If D has "open cokernels" then every extension in VD is equivalent to one of this form. Examples include the double categories Loc, Topos, Pos, and Cat, whose objects are locales, toposes, posets, and small categories, respectively; and Gamma(v) is given by Artin-Wraith glueing along v in the first two cases, and by the collage of v in the others.

Title: On the ternary commutator, I: Exact Mal'tsev categories
Authors: Cyrille Sandry Simeu, Tim Van der Linden
Abstract: In this first article on the Bulatov commutator, we introduce a ternary commutator of equivalence relations in the context of an exact Mal'tsev category with binary coproducts. We prove that, for Mal'tsev varieties, our notion is a particular case (where n=3) of the n-fold commutator introduced (originally in the context of Mal'tsev algebras) by A. Bulatov. We study its basic stability properties as well as the relationship with the (binary) Smith-Pedicchio commutator. In a forthcoming second article, we restrict the context to algebraically coherent semi-abelian categories, where we prove that the commutator introduced here corresponds to the ternary Higgins commutator of M. Hartl and the second author.

Title: Latent Fibrations: Fibrations for Categories of Partial Maps
Authors: Robin Cockett, Geoff Cruttwell, Jonathan Gallagher, Dorette Pronk
Abstract: Latent fibrations are an adaptation, appropriate for categories of partial maps (as presented by restriction categories), of the usual notion of fibration. This paper initiates the development of the basic theory of latent fibrations and explores some key examples. Latent fibrations cover a wide variety of examples, some of which are partial versions of standard fibrations, and some of which are particular to partial map categories (particularly those that arise in computational settings). Latent fibrations with various special properties are identified: hyperconnected latent fibrations, in particular, are shown to support the construction of a fibrational dual - important to reverse differential programming and, more generally, in the theory of lenses.

Title: Presentations of clusters and strict free-cocompletions
Authors: Erwan Beurier, Dominique Pastor, Ren&eacute; Guitart
Abstract: The clusters considered in this paper are seen as morphisms between small arbitrary diagrams in a given locally small category C. They have initially been introduced to extend to all small diagrams the results for filtered diagrams, by exhibiting a very basic presentation of the formula used in the definition of the category Ind(C) of ind-objects in C. They constitute a category Clu(C) which contains Ind(C). We study these clusters, their construction and composition. Thus we provide any user with the means to generate clusters and perform calculations with them. So we can give a simple proof of the fact that Clu(C) is a strict free cocompletion of C for all small diagrams, determined up to isomorphism. We compare it to some other cocompletion problems.

Title: Intrinsic Schreier special objects
Authors: Andrea Montoli, Diana Rodelo, Tim Van der Linden
Abstract: Motivated by the categorical-algebraic analysis of split epimorphisms of monoids, we study the concept of a special object induced by the intrinsic Schreier split epimorphisms in the context of a regular unital category with binary co-products, comonadic covers and a natural imaginary splitting in the sense of our article [21]. In this context, each object comes naturally equipped with an imaginary magma structure. We analyse the intrinsic Schreier split epimorphisms in this setting, showing that their properties improve when the imaginary magma structures happen to be associative. We compare the intrinsic Schreier special objects with the protomodular objects, and characterise them in terms of the imaginary magma structure. We furthermore relate them to the Engel property in the case of groups and Lie algebras.

Title: Action representability of the category of internal groupoids
Authors: Marino Gran, James Richard Andrew Gray
Abstract: When C is a semi-abelian category, it is well known that the category Grpd(C) of internal groupoids in C is again semi-abelian. The problem of determining whether the same kind of phenomenon occurs when the property of being semi-abelian is replaced by the one of being action representable (in the sense of Borceux, Janelidze and Kelly) turns out to be rather subtle. In the present article we give a sufficient condition for this to be true: in fact we prove that the category Grpd(C) is a semi-abelian action representable algebraically coherent category with normalizers if and only if C is a semi-abelian action representable algebraically coherent category with normalizers. This result applies in particular to the categories of internal groupoids in the categories of groups, Lie algebras and cocommutative Hopf algebras, for instance.

Abstract: We contribute to the formal theory of pseudomonads, i.e. the analogue for pseudomonads of the formal theory of monads. In particular, we solve a problem posed by Lack by proving that, for every Gray-category K, there is a Gray-category Psm(K) of pseudomonads, pseudomonad morphisms, pseudomonad transformations and pseudomonad modifications in K. We then establish a triequivalence between Psm(K) and the Gray-category of pseudomonads introduced by Marmolejo and give a simpler proof of the equivalence between pseudodistributive laws and liftings of pseudomonads to 2-categories of pseudoalgebras.

Abstract: We provide a method to construct recollements and ladders of triangulated categories. For a ladder of height n >= 2 of triangulated categories with good metrics, if all the functors are compression functors, then there is a ladder of height n-1 of the corresponding completion categories. In particular, for a recollement (a ladder of height 1) of triangulated categories with good metrics, if all the functors are compression functors, then there is a half recollement of the corresponding completion categories.

Title: Dependent products and 1-inaccessible universes
Authors: Giulio Lo Monaco
Abstract: The purpose of this writing is to explore the exact relationship running between geometric &infin;-toposes and Mike Shulman's proposal for the notion of elementary &infin;-topos, and in particular we will focus on the set-theoretical strength of Shulman's axioms, especially on the last one dealing with dependent sums and products, in the context of geometric &infin;-toposes. Heuristically, we can think of a collection of morphisms which has a classifier and is closed under these operations as a well-behaved internal universe in the &infin;-category under consideration. We will show that this intuition can in fact be made to a mathematically precise statement, by proving that, once fixed a Grothendieck universe, the existence of such internal universes in geometric &infin;-toposes is equivalent to the existence of smaller Grothendieck universes inside the bigger one. Moreover, a perfectly analogous result can be shown if instead of geometric &infin;-toposes our analysis relies on ordinary sheaf toposes, although with a slight change due to the impossibility of having true classifiers in the 1-dimensional setting. In conclusion, it will be shown that, under stronger assumptions positing the existence of intermediate-size Grothendieck universes, examples of elementary &infin;-toposes with strong universes which are not geometric can be found.

Abstract: We generalize the notion of ends and coends in category theory to the realm of module categories over finite tensor categories. We call this new concept module (co)end. This tool allows us to give different proofs to several known results in the theory of representations of finite tensor categories. As a new application, we present a description of the relative Serre functor for module categories in terms of a module coend, in a analogous way as a Morita invariant description of the Nakayama functor of abelian categories presented in [4].

Title: Simplicial sets inside cubical sets
Authors: Thomas Streicher, Jonathan Weinberger
Abstract: As observed recently by various people the topos sSet of simplicial sets appears as an essential subtopos of a topos cSet of cubical sets, namely presheaves over the category FL of finite lattices and monotone maps between them. The latter is a variant of the cubical model of type theory due to Cohen et al. for the purpose of providing a model for a variant of type theory which validates Voevodsky's Univalence Axiom and has computational meaning. <p> Our contribution consists in constructing in cSet a fibrant univalent universe for those types that are sheaves. This makes it possible to consider sSet as a submodel of cSet for univalent Martin-L&ouml;f type theory. <p> Furthermore, we address the question whether the type-theoretic Cisinski model structure considered on cSet coincides with the test model structure, the latter of which models the homotopy theory of spaces. We do not provide an answer to this open problem, but instead give a reformulation in terms of the adjoint functors at hand.

Title: Pivotal objects in monoidal categories and their Hopf monads
Authors: Aryan Ghobadi
Abstract: A pair of objects (P,Q) in a monoidal category C, is called a pivotal pair if there exist a family of duality morphisms, making Q both a left dual and a right dual of P. We introduce the correct notion of morphisms between such pairs, and thereby define the pivotal cover of a monoidal category. Given such a pair (P,Q), we construct the category C(P,Q), of objects which intertwine with P and Q in a compatible manner and show that C(P,Q) lifts the monoidal structure of C as well as the closed structure of C, when C is closed. If C has suitable colimits, we construct a family of Hopf monads which correspond to such pairs in C and present the resulting families of braided Hopf algebras and Hopf algebroids, when C is a braided category or the category of bimodules over a base algebra, respectively.

Title: Every elementary higher topos has a natural number object
Authors: Nima Rasekh
Abstract: We prove that every elementary (&infin;,1)-topos has a natural number object. We achieve this by defining the loop space of the circle and showing that we can construct a natural number object out of it. Part of the proof involves showing that various definitions of natural number objects (Lawvere, Freyd and Peano) agree with each other in an elementary (&infin;,1)-topos. As part of this effort we also study the internal object of contractibility in (&infin;,1)-categories, which is of independent interest. Finally, we discuss various applications of natural number objects. In particular, we use it to define internal sequential colimits in an elementary (&infin;,1)-topos.

This approach is convenient in describing the connection between split and regular Schreier epimorphisms of monoids.

Title: A closed model structure on the category of weakly unital dg categories, II
Authors: Piergiorgio Panero, Boris Shoikhet
Abstract: In this paper, which is subsequent to our previous paper (but can be read independently from it), we continue our study of the closed model structure on the category of small weakly unital dg categories (in the sense of Kontsevich-Soibelman) over a field. In our previous paper, we constructed a closed model structure on the category of weakly unital dg categories, imposing a technical condition on the weakly unital dg categories, namely the idempotency $\id_x\cdot \id_x=\id_x$ for any object. Although this condition led us to a great simplification, it was redundant and had to be dropped. <p> Here we get rid of this condition, and provide a closed model structure in full generality. The new closed model category is as well cofibrantly generated, and it is proven to be Quillen equivalent to the closed model category of (strictly unital) dg categories, given by Tabuada. Dropping the idempotency condition makes the construction of the closed model structure more distant from loc.cit., and requires new constructions. One of them is a pre-triangulated hull of a wu dg category, which in turn is shown to be a wu dg category as well. <p> One example of a weakly unital dg category which naturally appears is the bar-cobar resolution of a dg category. We supply this paper with a refinement of the classical bar-cobar resolution of a unital dg category which is strictly unital (appendix B). A similar construction can be applied to constructing a cofibrant resolution of weakly unital dg categories.

Title: Descent data and absolute Kan extensions
Authors: Fernando Lucatelli Nunes
Abstract: The fundamental construction underlying descent theory, the lax descent category, comes with a functor that forgets the descent data. We prove that, in any 2-category A with lax descent objects, the forgetful morphisms create all Kan extensions that are preserved by certain morphisms. As a consequence, in the case A = Cat, we get a monadicity theorem which says that a right adjoint functor is monadic if it is, up to the composition with an equivalence, (naturally isomorphic to) a functor that forgets descent data. In particular, within the classical context of descent theory, we show that, in a fibred category, the forgetful functor between the category of internal actions of a precategory a and the category of internal actions of the underlying discrete precategory is monadic if and only if it has a left adjoint. More particularly, this shows that one of the implications of the celebrated B&eacute;nabou-Roubaud theorem does not depend on the so called Beck-Chevalley condition. Namely, we prove that, in indexed categories, whenever an effective descent morphism induces a right adjoint functor, the induced functor is monadic.

Title: Left properness of flows

Abstract: Using Reedy techniques, this paper gives a correct proof of the left properness of the q-model structure of flows. It fixes the preceding proof which relies on an incorrect argument. The last section is devoted to fixing some arguments published in past papers coming from this incorrect argument. These Reedy techniques also enable us to study the interactions between the path space functor of flows with various notions of cofibrations. The proofs of this paper are written to work with many convenient categories of topological spaces like the ones of k-spaces and of weakly Hausdorff k-spaces and their locally presentable analogues, the &Delta;-generated spaces and the &Delta;-Hausdorff &Delta;-generated spaces.

Authors: Sanjeevi Krishnan, Paige Randall North
Abstract: This paper constructs an h-model structure for diagrams of streams, locally preordered spaces. Along the way, the paper extends some classical characterizations of Hurewicz fibrations and closed Hurewicz cofibrations. The usual characterization of classical closed Hurewicz cofibrations as inclusions of neighborhood deformation retracts extends. A characterization of classical Hurewicz fibrations as algebras over a pointed Moore cocylinder endofunctor also extends. An immediate consequence is a long exact sequence for directed homotopy monoids, with applications to safety verifications for database protocols.

Tensor topology realises that monoidal categories have an intrinsic notion of space, and deals with objects and maps that are partially defined with respect to this spatial structure. We introduce a construction that turns a firm monoidal category into a restriction category and axiomatise the monoidal restriction categories that arise this way, called tensor-restriction categories.

Abstract: We introduce, for C a regular Cartesian Reedy category a model category whose fibrant objects are an analogue of quasicategories enriched in simplicial presheaves on C. We then develop a coherent realization and nerve for this model structure and demonstrate that these give a Quillen equivalence, in particular recovering the classical one in the process. We then demonstrate that this equivalence descends to any Cartesian closed left Bousfield localization in a natural way. As an application, we demonstrate a version of Yoneda's lemma for quasicategories enriched in any such Cartesian closed localization.

Title: A categorical approach to quantum moment maps
Authors: Pavel Safronov
Abstract: We introduce quantum versions of Manin pairs and Manin triples and define quantum moment maps in this context. This provides a framework that incorporates quantum moment maps for actions of Lie algebras and quantum groups for any quantum parameter. We also show how our quantum moment maps degenerate to known classical versions of moment maps and describe their fusion.

Title: A practical type theory for symmetric monoidal categories
Authors: Michael Shulman
Abstract: We give a natural-deduction-style type theory for symmetric monoidal categories whose judgmental structure directly represents morphisms with tensor products in their codomain as well as their domain. The syntax is inspired by Sweedler notation for coalgebras, with variables associated to types in the domain and terms associated to types in the codomain, allowing types to be treated informally like "sets with elements" subject to global linearity-like restrictions. We illustrate the usefulness of this type theory with various applications to duality, traces, Frobenius monoids, and (weak) Hopf monoids.

Title: Locally anisotropic toposes II
Authors: Jonathon Funk, Pieter Hofstra
Abstract: Every Grothendieck topos has internal to it a canonical group object, called its isotropy. We continue our investigation of this group, focusing again on locally anisotropic toposes. Such a topos is one admitting an &eacute;tale cover by an anisotropic topos. We present a structural analysis of this class of toposes by showing that a topos is locally anisotropic if and only if it is equivalent to the topos of actions of a connected groupoid internal to an anisotropic topos. In particular we may conclude that a locally anisotropic topos, whence an &eacute;tendue, has isotropy rank at most one, meaning that its isotropy quotient has trivial isotropy.

Title: Cauchy completeness for DG-categories
Authors: Branko Nikoli&#263;, Ross Street, Giacomo Tendas
Abstract: We go back to the roots of enriched category theory and study categories enriched in chain complexes; that is, we deal with differential graded categories (DG-categories for short). In particular, we recall weighted colimits and provide examples. We solve the 50 year old question of how to characterize Cauchy complete DG-categories in terms of existence of some specific finite absolute colimits. As well as the interactions between absolute weighted colimits, we also examine the total complex of a chain complex in a DG-category as a non-absolute weighted colimit.

Title: Variation on a comprehensive theme
Authors: Ross Street
Abstract: The main result concerns a bicategorical factorization system on the bicategory Cat of categories and functors. Each functor f factors up to isomorphism as j, p where j is what we call an ultimate functor and p is what we call a groupoid fibration. Every right adjoint functor is ultimate. Functors whose ultimate factor is a right adjoint are shown to have bearing on the theory of polynomial functors.

A characterization of non-autocompact object is given, a general criterion of autocompactness of an object via the structure of its endomorphism ring is presented and a criterion of autocompactness of products is proven.

Authors: Rowan Poklewski-Koziell
Abstract: We define Frobenius-Eilenberg-Moore objects for a dagger Frobenius monad in an arbitrary dagger 2-category, and extend to the dagger context a well-known universal property of the formal theory of monads. We show that the free completion of a 2-category under Eilenberg-Moore objects extends to the dagger context, provided one is willing to work with those dagger Frobenius monads for which the endofunctor suitably commutes with the unit. Finally, we define dagger lax functors and dagger lax-limits of such functors, and show that Frobenius-Eilenberg-Moore objects are examples of such limits.

Title: 2-dimensional bifunctor theorems and distributive laws
Authors: Peter F. Faul, Graham Manuell, Jos&eacute; Siqueira
Abstract: In this paper we consider the conditions that need to be satisfied by two families of pseudofunctors with a common codomain for them to be collated into a bifunctor. We observe similarities between these conditions and distributive laws of monads before providing a unified framework from which both of these results may be inferred. We do this by proving a version of the bifunctor theorem for lax functors. We then show that these generalised distributive laws may be arranged into a 2-category Dist(B, C, D), which is equivalent to Lax_op(B,Lax_op(C,D)). The collation of a distributive law into its associated bifunctor extends to a 2-functor into Lax_op(B x C, D), which corresponds to uncurrying via the aforementioned equivalence. We also describe subcategories on which collation itself restricts to an equivalence. Finally, we exhibit a number of natural categorical constructions as special cases of our result.

Title: On sifted colimits in the presence of pullbacks
Authors: Ruiyuan Chen
Abstract: We show that in a category with pullbacks, arbitrary sifted colimits may be constructed as filtered colimits of reflexive coequalizers. This implies that "lex sifted colimits", in the sense of Garner-Lack, decompose as Barr-exactness plus filtered colimits commuting with finite limits. We also prove generalizations of these results for &kappa;-small sifted and filtered colimits, and their interaction with &lambda;-small limits in place of finite ones, generalizing Garner's characterization of algebraic exactness in the sense of Ad&aacute;mek-Lawvere-Rosick&yacute;. Along the way, we prove a general result on classes of colimits, showing that the &kappa;-small restriction of a saturated class of colimits is still "closed under iteration".

Title: On factorisation systems for Ord-enriched categories and categories of partial maps
Authors: Leonardo Larizza
Abstract: In this work we discuss a new type of factorisation system for Ord-enriched categories. We start by defining the new notion of lax weak orthogonality, which involves the existence of lax diagonal morphisms for lax squares. Using the usual theory of factorisation systems as a blueprint, we introduce a lax version of weak and functorial factorisation systems. We provide a characterisation of lax functorial weak factorisation systems, namely lax weak factorisation systems such that their factorisations are lax functorial. Then, we present a particular case of such lax functorial weak factorisation systems which are equipped with additional lax monad structures. We finally explore some examples of these factorisation systems for categories of partial maps equipped with natural Ord-enrichments. We will first construct a particular lax algebraic weak factorisation system for categories of partial maps that isolates the total datum and the partial domain of a partial map. Then we will discuss the relation between factorisation systems on the base category and oplax factorisation systems on the induced category of partial maps.

Title: Compact closed categories and &Gamma;-categories

Abstract: In this paper we develop a 2-categorical approach to coherence in compact closed categories. Our approach allows us to place compact closed categories within the context of homotopical algebra. More precisely, we construct two new model categories whose fibrant objects are (two different models of) compact closed categories. We prove a strictification theorem by showing a Quillen equivalence between the two.

Title: Detecting model categories among Quillen categories using homotopies
Authors: Seunghun Lee
Abstract: A model category has two weak factorizations, a pair of cofibrations and trivial fibrations and a pair of trivial cofibrations and fibrations. Then the class of weak equivalences is the set W consisting of the morphisms that can be decomposed into trivial cofibrations followed by trivial fibrations. One can build a model category out of such two weak factorizations by defining the class of weak equivalences by W as long as it satisfies the two out of three property. In this note we show that given a category with two weak factorizations, if every object is fibrant and cofibrant, W satisfies the two out of three property if and only if W is closed under the homotopies.

This significantly extends the present theory of Fra&iuml;ss&eacute; limits.

Title: On the classification of symplectic DQ-algebroids
Authors: Paul Bressler, Juan Diego Rojas
Abstract: DQ-algebroids locally defined on a symplectic manifold form a 2-gerbe. By adapting the method of P. Deligne to the setting of DQ-algebroids we show that this 2-gerbe admits a canonical global section, namely that every symplectic manifold admits a canonical DQ-algebroid quantizing the structure sheaf. The construction relies on methods of non-abelian cohomology and local computations in the Weyl algebra. As a corollary we obtain a classification of symplectic DQ-algebroids.

Title: Q-system completion is a 3-functor
Authors: Quan Chen, David Penneys
Abstract: Q-systems are unitary versions of Frobenius algebra objects which appeared in the theory of subfactors. In recent joint work with R. Hern&aacute;ndez Palomares and C. Jones, the authors defined a notion of Q-system completion for C*/W* 2-categories, which is a unitary version of a higher idempotent completion in the spirit of Douglas-Reutter and Gaiotto-Johnson-Freyd. In this article, we prove that Q-system completion is a dagger 3-functor on the dagger 3-category of C*/W* 2-categories. We also prove that Q-system completion satisfies a universal property analogous to the universal property satisfied by idempotent completion for 1-categories.

Title: The closed model structure on the category of weakly unital dg categories: an addendum
Authors: Piergiorgio Panero, Boris Shoikhet
Abstract: This paper is an addendum to our paper [PS], where a closed model structure on the category C_{\dgwu}(k) of small (Kontsevich-Soibelman) weakly unital dg categories is constructed, k a field of any characteristic. In [PS], we referred to our earlier preprint for proofs of the following results: (A) small (co)completeness of C_{\dgwu}(k), and (B) the non-symmetric dg operad O' (which governs weakly unital dg categories acting on k-quivers, we recall its definition in Section 2.12) is quasi-isomorphic to the operad of unital associative algebras Assoc_+, under a natural projection. Recall that the (co)completeness in (A) is the first axiom of a closed model category, while (B) was crucial in the proof in [PS, Th. 5.3] of the Quillen equivalence between C_{\dgwu}(k) (equipped with our model structure) and the category of small dg categories C_{\dgwu}(k) (equipped with the Tabuada model structure for which the weak equivalences are quasi-equivalences). In this paper we collect our earlier proofs of (A) and (B), which serves as an addendum to [PS], and makes these two papers self-contained.

Authors: Daniel Dugger
Abstract: We introduce some general categorical machinery for studying Gysin functors (certain kinds of functors with transfers) and their associated categories of correspondences. These correspondence categories are closed, symmetric monoidal categories where all objects are self-dual. We also prove a limited reconstruction theorem: given such a closed, symmetric monoidal category (and some extra information) it is isomorphic to the correspondence category associated to a Gysin functor. Finally, if k is a field we use this technology to define and explore a new construction called the Grothendieck-Witt category of k.

Title: The Interpretation Lifting Theorem for C-Systems
Authors: Anthony Bordg
Abstract: In this article we present a solution to a conjecture of Vladimir Voevodsky regarding C-systems. This conjecture provides, under some assumptions, a lift of a functor M: CC -> C, where CC is a C-system and C a category, to a morphism of C-systems M': CC -> CC(\hat{C}, p_M). We explain the motivation behind this conjecture and introduce the required background material on C-systems. Finally, we give a proof of this conjecture. As we shall see the corresponding theorem allows to lift weak interpretations of type theory to strong ones.

In the latter case, our work reduces the two-dimensional Cobordism Hypothesis of Baez-Dolan to a comparison problem between two explicitly defined bicategories.

Title: A note on images of cover relations
Authors: J. R. A. Gray
Abstract: For a category C, a small category I, and a pre-cover relation c on C we prove, under certain completeness assumptions on C, that a morphism g: B -> C in the functor category C^I has a c^I-image, where c^I is the pre-cover relation on C^I induced by c, as soon as each component of g has a c-image. We then apply this to show that if a pointed category C is: (i) algebraically cartesian closed; (ii) exact protomodular and action accessible; or (iii) admits normalizers, then the same is true of each functor category C^I with I finite. In addition, our results give explicit constructions of c^I-images in functor categories using limits and c-images in the underlying category. In particular, they can be used to give explicit constructions of both centralizers and normalizers in functor categories using limits and centralizers or normalizers (respectively) in the underlying category.

We use the technique to give efficient proofs of many standard coherence theorems and new coherence results for bicategories with shadow and for their functors.

Title: Linearizing Combinators
Authors: Robin Cockett, Jean-Simon Pacaud Lemay
Abstract: In 2017, Bauer, Johnson, Osborne, Riehl, and Tebbe (BJORT) showed that the abelian functor calculus provides an example of a Cartesian differential category. The definition of a Cartesian differential category is based on a differential combinator which directly formalizes the total derivative from multivariable calculus. However, in the aforementioned work the authors used techniques from Goodwillie's functor calculus to establish a linearization process from which they then derived a differential combinator. This raised the question of what the precise relationship between linearization and having a differential combinator might be. <p> In this paper, we introduce the notion of a linearizing combinator which abstracts linearization in the abelian functor calculus. We then use it to provide an alternative axiomatization of a Cartesian differential category. Every Cartesian differential category comes equipped with a canonical linearizing combinator obtained by differentiation at zero. Conversely, a differential combinator can be constructed &agrave; la BJORT when one has a system of partial linearizing combinators in each context. Thus, while linearizing combinators do provide an alternative axiomatization of Cartesian differential categories, an explicit notion of partial linearization is required. This is in contrast to the situation for differential combinators where partial differentiation is automatic in the presence of total differentiation. The ability to form a system of partial linearizing combinators from a total linearizing combinator, while not being possible in general, is possible when the setting is Cartesian closed.

Title: A modular functor from state sums for finite tensor categories and their bimodules
Authors: J&uuml;rgen Fuchs, Gregor Schaumann, Christoph Schweigert
Abstract: We construct a modular functor which takes its values in the monoidal bicategory of finite categories, left exact functors and natural transformations. The modular functor is defined on bordisms that are 2-framed. Accordingly we do not need to require that the finite categories appearing in our construction are semisimple, nor that the finite tensor categories that are assigned to two-dimensional strata are endowed with a pivotal structure. Our prescription can be understood as a state-sum construction. The state-sum variables are assigned to one-dimensional strata and take values in bimodule categories over finite tensor categories, whereby we also account for the presence of boundaries and defects. Our construction allows us to explicitly compute functors associated to surfaces and representations of mapping class groups acting on them.

Abstract: We introduce twisted arrow categories of operads and of algebras over operads. Up to equivalence of categories, the simplex category &Delta;, Segal's category &Gamma;, Connes cyclic category &Lambda;, Moerdijk-Weiss dendroidal category &Omega;, and categories similar to graphical categories of Hackney-Robertson-Yau are twisted arrow categories of symmetric or cyclic operads. Twisted arrow categories of operads admit Segal presheaves and 2-Segal presheaves, or decomposition spaces. Twisted arrow category of an operad P is the (&#8734;, 1)-localization of the corresponding category &Omega;/P by the boundary preserving morphisms. Under mild assumptions, twisted arrow categories of operads, and closely related universal enveloping categories, are generalized Reedy. We also introduce twisted arrow operads, which are related to Baez-Dolan plus construction.

Authors: Rory B. B. Lucyshyn-Wright, Jason Parker
Abstract: We define and study the notion of a locally bounded enriched category over a (locally bounded) symmetric monoidal closed category, generalizing the locally bounded ordinary categories of Freyd and Kelly. In addition to proving several general results for constructing examples of locally bounded enriched categories and locally bounded closed categories, we demonstrate that locally bounded enriched categories admit fully enriched analogues of many of the convenient results enjoyed by locally bounded ordinary categories. In particular, we prove full enrichments of Freyd and Kelly's reflectivity and local boundedness results for orthogonal subcategories and categories of models for sketches and theories. We also provide characterization results for locally bounded enriched categories in terms of enriched presheaf categories, and we show that locally bounded enriched categories admit useful adjoint functor theorems and a representability theorem. We also define and study the notion of &alpha;-bounded-small weighted limit enriched in a locally &alpha;-bounded closed category, which parallels Kelly's notion of &alpha;-small weighted limit enriched in a locally &alpha;-presentable closed category, and we show that enriched categories of models of &alpha;-bounded-small weighted limit theories are locally &alpha;-bounded.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the taxonomy of finitely complete categories, based on 'matrix properties' - these are a particular type of exactness properties that can be represented by integer matrices. In particular, the main result of the paper gives an algorithm for deciding whether a conjunction of such properties implies another such property. Computer implementation of this algorithm allows one to peer into the complex structure of the poset of `matrix classes', i.e., the poset of all collections of finitely complete categories determined by matrix properties. Among elements of this poset are the collections of Mal'tsev categories, majority categories, (finitely complete) arithmetical categories, as well as finitely complete extensions of various classes of varieties defined by a special type of Mal'tsev conditions found in the literature.

Title: On the dearth of coproducts in the category of locally compact groups
Authors: Alexandru Chirvasitu
Abstract: We prove that a family of at least two non-trivial, almost-connected locally compact groups cannot have a coproduct in the category of locally compact groups if at least one of the groups is connected; this confirms the intuition that coproducts in said category are rather hard to come by, save for the usual ones in the category of discrete groups. Along the way we also prove a number of auxiliary results on characteristic indices of locally compact or Lie groups as defined by Iwasawa: that characteristic indices can only decrease when passing to semisimple closed Lie subgroups, and also along dense-image morphisms.

Title: Probability monads as codensity monads
Authors: Ruben Van Belle
Abstract: We show from a categorical point of view that probability measures on certain measurable or topological spaces arise canonically as the extension of probability distributions on countable sets. We do this by constructing probability monads as the codensity monads of functors that send a countable set to the space of probability distributions on that set. On (pre)measurable spaces we discuss monads of probability (pre)measures and their finitely additive analogues. We also give codensity constructions for monads of Radon measures on compact Hausdorff spaces and compact metric spaces and for the monad of Baire measures on Hausdorff spaces. A crucial role in these constructions is given by integral representation theorems, which we derive from a generalized Daniell-Stone theorem.

Title: The bicategory of topological correspondences
Authors: Rohit Dilip Holkar
Abstract: It is known that a topological correspondence (X,\lambda) from a locally compact groupoid with a Haar system (G,\alpha) to another one, (H,\beta), produces a C*-correspondence H(X,\lambda) from C^*(G,\alpha) to C^*(H,\beta). We described the composition of two topological correspondences in one of our earlier articles. In the present article, we prove that second countable locally compact Hausdorff groupoids with Haar systems form a bicategory T when equipped with topological correspondences as 1-arrows and isomorphisms of topological correspondences as 2-arrows. On the other hand, it well-known that C*-algebras form a bicategory C with C*-correspondences as 1-arrows, and the unitary isomorphisms of Hilbert C*-modules that intertwine the representations serve as the 2-arrows. In this article, we show that a topological correspondence going to a C*-one is a bifunctor T to C. Finally, we show that in the sub-bicategory of T consisting of the Macho-Stadler-O'uchi correspondences, invertible 1-arrows are exactly the groupoid equivalences.

Title: Extensivity of categories of relational structures
Authors: Jason Parker
Abstract: We prove that the category of models of any relational Horn theory satisfying a mild syntactic condition is infinitely extensive. Central examples of such categories include the categories of preordered sets and partially ordered sets, and the categories of small V-categories, (symmetric) pseudo-V-metric spaces, and (symmetric) V-metric spaces for a commutative unital quantale V. We also explicitly characterize initial sources and final sinks in such categories, and in particular embeddings and quotients.

Title: Bicategories of fractions revisited: towards small homs and canonical 2-cells
Authors: Dorette Pronk, Laura Scull
Abstract: This paper addresses two issues in dealing with bicategories of fractions. The first is to introduce a set of conditions on a class of arrows in a bicategory which is weaker than the one given in [5] but still allows a bicalculus of fractions. These conditions allow us to invert a smaller collection of arrows so that in some cases we may obtain a bicategory of fractions with small hom-categories. We adapt the construction of the bicategory of fractions to work with the weaker conditions. The second issue is the difficulty in dealing with 2-cells, which are defined by equivalence classes. We discuss conditions under which there are canonical representatives for 2-cells, and how pasting of 2-cells can be simplified in the presence of certain pseudo pullbacks. We also discuss how both of these improvements apply in the category of orbispaces.

Title: Pushforwards and Gauge Transformations for Categorical Connections
Authors: Saikat Chatterjee, Amitabha Lahiri, Ambar N. Sengupta
Abstract: We construct and establish results for a categorical counterpart of pushforwards of connections on principal bundles. This categorical pushforward takes as input a categorical connection A_P on a categorical bundle P and an appropriate functor S: P -> Q and outputs a categorical connection S_*A_P on the categorical bundle Q. Applying this construction to the case of categorical bundles arising from decorated path spaces in principal bundles, we obtain a transformation of classical connections that combines the traditional gauge transformation with an affine translation.

Title: Composing PROBs
Authors: Daniel Graves
Abstract: A PROB is a "product and braid" category. Such categories can be used to encode the structure borne by an object in a braided monoidal category. In this paper we provide PROBs whose categories of algebras in a braided monoidal category are equivalent to the categories of monoids and comonoids using the category associated to the braid crossed simplicial group of Fiedorowicz and Loday. We show that PROBs can be composed by generalizing the machinery introduced by Lack for PROPs. We use this to define a PROB for bimonoids in a braided monoidal category as a composite of the PROBs for monoids and comonoids.

Title: A topos for continuous logic
Authors: Daniel Figueroa, Benno van den Berg
Abstract: We suggest an ordering for the predicates in continuous logic so that the semantics of continuous logic can be formulated as a hyperdoctrine. We show that this hyperdoctrine can be embedded into the hyperdoctrine of subobjects of a suitable Grothendieck topos. For this embedding we use a simplification of the hyperdoctrine for continuous logic, whose category of equivalence relations is equivalent to the category of complete metric spaces and uniformly continuous maps.

Title: Gray-categories model algebraic tricategories
Authors: Giovanni Ferrer
Abstract: Lack described a Quillen model structure on the category GrayCat of Gray-categories and Gray-functors, for which the weak equivalences are the weak 3-equivalences. Restricted to Gray-groupoids, the resulting homotopy category is equivalent to the homotopy category of 3-types. In this note, we adapt the technique of Gurski, Johnson, and Osorno to show the localization of GrayCat at the weak equivalences is equivalent to the category of algebraic tricategories and pseudo-natural equivalence classes of weak 3-functors. This finishes establishing the homotopy hypothesis for algebraic trigroupoids.

Title: Non-pointed abelian categories
Authors: Arnaud Duvieusart, Sandra Mantovani, Andrea Montoli
Abstract: We study a property (P) of pushouts of regular epimorphisms along monomorphisms in a regular context. We prove that (P) characterizes abelian categories among homological ones. In the non-pointed case, we show that (P) implies the normality (in the sense of Bourn) of all subobjects, that any protomodular category satisfying (P) is naturally Mal’tsev, and that an exact category is penessentially affine if and only if it is protomodular and satisfies (P). An example of such a category is the one whose objects are the abelian extensions over an object in a (strongly) semi-abelian category; by exploiting some observations in this context, we also provide a characterization of strongly semi-abelian categories by a variant of the axiom of normality of unions.

Title: Double Categories of Relations
Authors: Michael Lambert
Abstract: A `double category of relations' is defined in this paper as a cartesian equipment in which every object is suitably discrete. The main result is a characterization theorem that a `double category of relations' is equivalent to a double category of relations on a regular category when it has strong and monic tabulators and a double-categorical subobject comprehension scheme. This result is based in part on the recent characterization of double categories of spans due to Aleiferi. The overall development can be viewed as a double-categorical version of that of the notion of a "functionally complete bicategory of relations" or a "tabular allegory".

Authors: Manuel Ara&uacute;jo
Abstract: We define a monad T_n^D^* whose operations are encoded by simple string diagrams and we define n-sesquicategories as algebras over this monad. This monad encodes the compositional structure of n-dimensional string diagrams. We give a generators and relations description of T_n^D^*, which allows us to describe n-sesquicategories as globular sets equipped with associative and unital composition and whiskering operations. One can also see them as strict n-categories without interchange laws. Finally we give an inductive characterization of n-sesquicategories.

Title: Central extensions of associative algebras and weakly action representable categories
Authors: George Janelidze
Abstract: A central extension is a regular epimorphism in a Barr exact category C satisfying suitable conditions involving a given Birkhoff subcategory of C (joint work with G. M. Kelly, 1994). In this paper we take C to be the category of (not-necessarily-unital) algebras over a (unital) commutative ring and consider central extensions with respect to the category of commutative algebras. We propose a new approach that avoids the intermediate notion of central extension due to A. Fr&ouml;hlich in showing that $\alpha:A\to B$ is a central extension if and only if $aa'=a'a$ for all $a,a'\in A$ with $\alpha(a')=0$. This approach motivates introducing what we call weakly action representable categories, and we show that such categories are always action accessible. We also make remarks on what we call initial weak representations of actions and formulate several open questions.

Title: Cohomologies, extensions and deformations of differential algebras of arbitrary weight
Authors: Li Guo, Yunnan Li, Yunhe Sheng, Guodong Zhou
Abstract: As an algebraic structure underlying the differential calculus and differential equations, a differential algebra is an associative algebra equipped with a linear map satisfying the Leibniz rule. The subject has been studied for about a century and has become an important area of mathematics. In recent years the area has been expanded to the noncommutative associative and Lie algebra contexts and to the case when the defining operator identity has a weight in order to include difference operators. This paper provides a cohomology theory for differential algebras of arbitrary weight, via a uniform approach to cover both the zero weight case which is similar to the earlier study of differential Lie algebras, and the non-zero weight case which poses challenges. The cohomology of a differential algebra is related to the Hochschild cohomology by a type of long exact sequence for relative homology. As an application, abelian extensions of a differential algebra are classified by the second cohomology group. Furthermore, formal deformations of a differential algebra are characterized by the second cohomology group and the rigidity of a differential algebra is characterized by the vanishing of the second cohomology group.

Title: Presentations and algebraic colimits of enriched monads for a subcategory of arities
Authors: Rory B. B. Lucyshyn-Wright, Jason Parker
Abstract: We develop a general framework for studying signatures, presentations, and algebraic colimits of enriched monads for a subcategory of arities, even when the base of enrichment V is not locally presentable. When V satisfies the weaker requirement of local boundedness, the resulting framework is sufficiently general to apply to the &Phi;-accessible monads of Lack and Rosick&yacute; and the J-ary monads of the first author, while even without local boundedness our framework captures in full generality the presentations of strongly finitary monads of Lack and Kelly as well as Wolff's presentations of V-categories by generators and relations. Given any small subcategory of arities j : J -> C in an enriched category C, satisfying certain assumptions, we prove results on the existence of free J-ary monads, the monadicity of J-ary monads over J-signatures, and the existence of algebraic colimits of J-ary monads. We study a notion of presentation for J-ary monads and show that every such presentation presents a J-ary monad. Certain of our results generalize earlier results of Kelly, Power, and Lack for finitary enriched monads in the locally finitely presentable setting, as well as analogous results of Kelly and Lack for strongly finitary monads on cartesian closed categories. Our main results hold for a wide class of subcategories of arities in locally bounded enriched categories.

Title: Moment categories and operads
Authors: Clemens Berger
Abstract: A moment category is endowed with a distinguished set of split idempotents, called moments, which can be transported along morphisms. Equivalently, a moment category is a category with an active/inert factorisation system fulfilling two simple axioms. These axioms imply that the moments of a fixed object form a monoid, actually a left regular band. Each locally finite unital moment category defines a specific type of operad which records the combinatorics of partitioning moments into elementary ones. In this way the notions of symmetric, non-symmetric and n-operad correspond to unital moment structures on &Gamma;, &Delta; and &Theta;_n respectively. There is an analog of the plus construction of Baez-Dolan taking a unital moment category C to a unital hypermoment category C^+. Under this construction, C-operads get identified with C^+-monoids, i.e. presheaves on C^+ satisfying strict Segal conditions. We show that the plus construction of Segal's category &Gamma; embeds into the dendroidal category &Omega; of Moerdijk-Weiss.

Title: Modular operads as modules over the Brauer properad
Authors: Robin Stoll
Abstract: We show that modular operads are equivalent to modules over a certain simple properad which we call the Brauer properad. Furthermore, we show that, in this setting, the Feynman transform corresponds to the cobar construction for modules of this kind. To make this precise, we extend the machinery of the bar and cobar constructions relative to a twisting morphism to modules over a general properad. This generalizes the classical case of algebras over an operad and might be of independent interest. As an application, we sketch a Koszul duality theory for modular operads.

Title: Indeterminacies and models of homotopy limits
Authors: Alisa Govzmann, Damjan Pistalo, Norbert Poncin
Abstract: In a previous paper, we studied the indeterminacy of the value of a derived functor at an object using different definitions of a derived functor and different types of fibrant replacement. In the present work we focus on derived or homotopy limits, which of course depend on the model structure of the diagram category under consideration. The latter is not necessarily unique, which is an additional source of indeterminacy. In the case of homotopy pullbacks, we introduce the concept of full homotopy pullback by identifying the homotopy pullbacks associated with three different model structures of the category of cospan diagrams, thus increasing the number of canonical representatives. Finally, we define generalized representatives or models of homotopy limits and full homotopy pullbacks. The concept of model is a unifying approach that includes the homotopy pullback used by J. Lurie and the homotopy fiber square defined by P. Hirschorn in right proper model categories. Properties of the latter are generalized to models in any model category.

Later, several authors have extended this construction to wider contexts, including the Gleason cover for an elementary topos introduced by Johnstone in 1980.

Authors: Junche Yu, Dexue Zhang
Abstract: The Hofmann-Mislove theorem says that the ordered set of open filters of the open-set lattice of a sober topological space is isomorphic to the ordered set of compact saturated sets (ordered by reverse inclusion) of that space. This paper concerns a metric analogy of this result. To this end, the notion of compact functions of approach spaces is introduced. Such functions are an analog of compact subsets in the enriched context. It is shown that for a sober approach space X, the metric space of proper open [0,&infin;]-filters of the metric space of upper regular functions of X is isomorphic to the opposite of the metric space of inhabited and saturated compact functions of X, establishing a Hofmann-Mislove theorem for approach spaces.

Title: Finite symmetries of quantum character stacks
Authors: Corina Keller, Lukas M&uuml;ller
Abstract: For a finite group D, we study categorical factorisation homology on oriented surfaces equipped with principal D-bundles, which "integrates" a (linear) balanced braided category A with D-action over those surfaces. For surfaces with at least one boundary component, we identify the value of factorisation homology with the category of modules over an explicit algebra in A, extending the work of Ben-Zvi, Brochier and Jordan to surfaces with D-bundles. Furthermore, we show that the value of factorisation homology on annuli, boundary conditions, and point defects can be described in terms of equivariant representation theory. Our main example comes from an action of Dynkin diagram automorphisms on representation categories of quantum groups. We show that in this case factorisation homology gives rise to a quantisation of the moduli space of flat twisted bundles.

Title: A Gray-categorical pasting theorem
Authors: Nicola Di Vittorio
Abstract: The notion of Gray-category, a semi-strict 3-category in which the middle four interchange is weakened to an isomorphism, is central in the study of three-dimensional category theory. In this context it is common practice to use 2-dimensional pasting diagrams to express composites of 2-cells, however there is no thorough treatment in the literature justifying this procedure. We fill this gap by providing a formal approach to pasting in Gray-categories and by proving that such composites are uniquely defined up to a contractible groupoid of choices.

Abstract: A new notion of a (pointed) semibiproduct is introduced, which, in the case of groups amounts to an extension equipped with a set-theoretical section. When the section is a group homomorphism then a pointed semibiproduct is the same as a group split extension.

Title: On the construction of Noetherian forms for algebraic structures
Authors: Francois Koch van Niekerk
Abstract: A Noetherian form is a self-dual axiomatic context in which the Noether isomorphism theorems and other homomorphism theorems can be established. These theorems for group-like algebraic structures (for example groups, rings without unity and vector spaces) can be obtained by choosing a Noetherian form based on lattices of subalgebras. In this paper we show that by replacing lattices of subalgebras with some other lattices, it becomes possible to move beyond group-like structures and encompass all types of algebraic structures (including sets, monoids, lattices). Moreover, we show that in a suitable sense, existence of a Noetherian form for a give type of mathematical structure is intimately linked with algebraicity of structures. The isomorphism theorems resulting from applying these Noetherian forms recover the isomorphism theorems known for general algebraic structures in the literature.

Authors: Oren Ben-Bassat, Kobi Kremnizer
Abstract: Motivated by classical functional analysis results over the complex numbers and results in the bornological setting over the complex numbers of R. Meyer, we study several aspects of the study of Ind-Banach modules over Banach rings. This allows for a synthesis of some aspects of homological algebra and functional analysis. This includes a study of nuclear modules and of modules which are flat with respect to the projective tensor product. We also study metrizable and Fr&eacute;chet Ind-Banach modules. We give explicit descriptions of projective limits of Banach rings as ind-objects. We study exactness properties of the projective tensor product with respect to kernels and countable products. As applications, we describe a theory of quasi-coherent modules in Banach algebraic geometry. We prove descent theorems for quasi-coherent modules in various analytic and arithmetic contexts and relate them to well known complexes of modules coming from covers.

Title: Partial evaluations and the compositional structure of the bar construction
Authors: Carmen Constantin, Tobias Fritz, Paolo Perrone, Brandon T. Shapiro
Abstract: The algebraic expression 3 + 2 + 6 can be evaluated to 11, but it can also be <i>partially evaluated</i> to 5 + 6. In categorical algebra, such partial evaluations can be defined in terms of the 1-skeleton of the bar construction for algebras of a monad. We show that this partial evaluation relation can be seen as the relation internal to the category of algebras generated by relating a formal expression to its total evaluation. The relation is transitive for many monads which describe commonly encountered algebraic structures, and more generally for BC monads on Set (which are those monads for which the underlying functor and the multiplication are weakly cartesian). We find that this is not true for all monads: we describe a finitary monad on Set for which the partial evaluation relation on the terminal algebra is not transitive. With the perspective of higher algebraic rewriting in mind, we then investigate the compositional structure of the bar construction in all dimensions. We show that for algebras of BC monads, the bar construction has fillers for all <i>directed acyclic configurations</i> in &Delta;^n, but generally not all inner horns.

Title: Colimits in enriched &infin;-categories and Day convolution
Authors: Vladimir Hinich
Abstract: Let M be a monoidal &infin;-category with colimits. In this paper we study colimits of M-functors A --> B where B is left-tensored over M and A is an M-enriched category. We prove that the enriched Yoneda embedding Y: A --> P_M(A) yields a universal M-functor. In case when A has a certain monoidal structure, the category of enriched presheaves P_M(A) inherits the same monoidal structure and the enriched Yoneda embedding acquires the structure of universal monoidal M-functor.

Authors: Michael Hoefnagel
Abstract: We study centrality of morphisms in a setting derived from that of a pointed category in which finite products commute with coequalisers. The main results of this paper show that much of the behaviour of central morphisms for unital categories is retained in our setting, including categories which are (weakly) unital, but also categories outside of the unital setting.

Title: Rank-based persistence
Authors: Mattia G. Bergomi, Pietro Vertechi
Abstract: Persistence has proved to be a valuable tool to analyze real world data robustly. Several approaches to persistence have been attempted over time, some topological in flavor, based on the vector space-valued homology functor, others combinatorial, based on arbitrary set-valued functors. To unify the study of topological and combinatorial persistence in a common categorical framework, we give axioms for a generalized rank function on objects in a target category so that functors to that category induce persistence functions. We port the interleaving and bottleneck distances to this novel framework and generalize classical equalities and inequalities. Unlike sets and vector spaces, in many categories the rank of an object does not identify it up to isomorphism: to preserve information about the structure of persistence modules, we define colorable ranks, persistence diagrams and prove the equality between multicolored bottleneck distance and interleaving distance in semisimple Abelian categories. To illustrate our framework in practice, we give examples of multicolored persistent homology on filtered topological spaces with a group action and labeled point cloud data.

Title: The over-topos at a model
Authors: Olivia Caramello, Axel Osmond
Abstract: With a model of a geometric theory in an arbitrary topos, we associate a site obtained by endowing a category of generalized elements of the model with a Grothendieck topology, which we call the antecedent topology. Then we show that the associated sheaf topos, which we call the over-topos at the given model, admits a canonical totally connected morphism to the given base topos and satisfies a universal property generalizing that of the colocalization of a topos at a point. We first treat the case of the base topos of sets, where global elements are sufficient to describe our site of definition; in this context, we also introduce a geometric theory classified by the over-topos, whose models can be identified with the model homomorphisms towards the (internalizations of the) model. Then we formulate and prove the general statement over an arbitrary topos, which involves the stack of generalized elements of the model.

Title: Exponentiability in categories of relational structures
Authors: Jason Parker
Abstract: For a relational Horn theory T, we provide useful sufficient conditions for the exponentiability of objects and morphisms in the category T-mod of T-models; well-known examples of such categories, which have found recent applications in the study of programming language semantics, include the categories of preordered sets and (extended) metric spaces. As a consequence, we obtain useful sufficient conditions for T-mod to be cartesian closed, locally cartesian closed, and even a quasitopos; in particular, we provide two different explanations for the cartesian closure of the categories of preordered and partially ordered sets. Our results recover (the sufficiency of) certain conditions that have been shown by Niefield and Clementino-Hofmann to characterize exponentiability in the category of partially ordered sets and the category V-cat of small V-categories for certain commutative unital quantales V.

Title: Quasi-uniform Structures and Functors
Authors: Minani Iragi, David Holgate
Abstract: We study a number of categorical quasi-uniform structures induced by functors. We depart from a category C with a proper (E,M)-factorization system, then define the continuity of a C-morphism with respect to two syntopogenous structures (in particular with respect to two quasi-uniformities) on C and use it to describe the quasi-uniformities induced by pointed and copointed endofunctors of C. In particular, we demonstrate that every quasi-uniformity on a reflective subcategory of C can be lifted to a coarsest quasi-uniformity on C for which every reflection morphism is continuous.

Abstract: This paper gives an explicit description of the categorical operad whose algebras are precisely symmetric monoidal categories. This allows us to place the operad in a sequence of four, thus generating a sequence of four successively stricter concepts of symmetric monoidal category. A companion paper will use this operadic presentation to describe a vast array of underlying multicategories for a symmetric monoidal category.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of Rota-Baxter Lie 2-algebras, which is a categorification of Rota-Baxter Lie algebras. We prove that the category of Rota-Baxter Lie 2-algebras and the category of 2-term Rota-Baxter L_\infty-algebras are equivalent. We introduce the notion of a crossed module of Rota-Baxter Lie algebras, and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between strict 2-term Rota-Baxter L_\infty-algebras and crossed modules of Rota-Baxter Lie algebras. At last, as applications of the crossed modules of Rota-Baxter Lie algebras, we give constructions of crossed modules of pre-Lie algebras and crossed modules of Lie algebras from them.

Abstract: We consider the internalization of the usual notion of principal bundle in a site that has all pullbacks and a terminal object. We use this notion to consider the explicit construction of quotient prestacks via presheaves of categories of principal bundles equipped with equivariant morphisms in this abstract context. We then prove that, if the site is subcanonical and the underlying category satisfies some mild conditions, these quotient prestacks satisfy descent in the sense of stacks.

Abstract: The category LAlg of L-algebras is shown to be complete and cocomplete, regular with a zero object and a projective generator, normal and subtractive, ideal determined, but not Barr-exact. Originating from algebraic logic, L-algebras arise in the theory of Garside groups, measure theory, functional analysis, and operator theory. It is shown that the category LAlg is far from protomodular, but it has natural semidirect products which have not been described in category-theoretic terms.

Authors: Leandro Mar&iacute;n, Valdis Laan
Abstract: In this paper we define firm homomorphisms between rings without identity in such a way that the category of rings with identity will become a full subcategory of the category of firm rings with firm homomorphisms as morphisms. We prove that firm homomorphisms are in one-to-one correspondence with pairs of compatible concrete functors between certain module categories. This correspondence is given by the restriction of scalars. We also prove the semigroup theoretic analogues of these results and give a list of examples of firm homomorphisms.

Title: Symmetries of data sets and functoriality of persistent homology
Authors: Wojciech Chach&oacute;lski, Alessandro De Gregorio, Nicola Quercioli, Francesca Tombari
Abstract: The aim of this article is to describe a new perspective on functoriality of persistent homology and explain its intrinsic symmetry that is often overlooked. A data set for us is a finite collection of functions, called measurements, with a finite domain. Such a data set might contain internal symmetries which are effectively captured by the action of a set of the domain endomorphisms. Different choices of the set of endomorphisms encode different symmetries of the data set. We describe various category structures on such enriched data sets and prove some of their properties such as decompositions and morphism formations. We also describe a data structure, based on coloured directed graphs, which is convenient to encode the mentioned enrichment. We show that persistent homology preserves only some aspects of these collection of enriched data sets however not all. In other words persistent homology is not a functor on the entire category of enriched data sets. Nevertheless we show that persistent homology is functorial locally. We use the concept of set equivariant operator (SEO) to capture some of the information missed by persistent homology. Moreover, we provide examples and give ways to construct such SEOs.

Abstract: We study ideals in, and continuity of, quantaloid-enriched categories (Q-categories for short) as a `many-valued and many-typed' generalization of domain theory. Abstractly, for any (saturated) class &Phi; of presheaves, we define and study the &Phi;-continuity of Q-categories. Concretely, we compute three examples of such saturated classes of presheaves - the class of flat ideals, the class of irreducible ideals and the class of conical ideals - which are proper generalizations of ideals in domain theory.

As a corollary of the second named author's proof of the existence of the canonical left semi-model structure for Grothendieck 3-groupoids, we obtain a proof of the homotopy hypothesis for Grothendieck 3-groupoids.

Abstract: We extend Deligne's notion of determinant functor to tensor triangulated categories. Specifically, to account for the multiexact structure of the tensor, we define a determinant functor on the 2-multicategory of triangulated categories and we provide a multicategorical version of the universal determinant functor for triangulated categories whose multiexactness properties are conveniently captured by a certain complex modeled by cubical shapes, which we introduce along the way. We then show that for a tensor triangulated category whose tensor admits a Verdier structure the resulting determinant functor takes values in a categorical ring.

Title: Hopf Monads on Biproducts
Authors: Masahito Hasegawa, Jean-Simon Pacaud Lemay
Abstract: A Hopf monad, in the sense of Bruguières, Lack, and Virelizier, is a special kind of monad that can be defined for any monoidal category. In this note, we study Hopf monads in the case of a category with finite biproducts, seen as a symmetric monoidal category. We show that for biproducts, a Hopf monad is precisely characterized as a monad equipped with an extra natural transformation satisfying three axioms, which we call a fusion invertor. We will also consider three special cases: representable Hopf monads, idempotent Hopf monads, and when the category also has negatives. In these cases, the fusion invertor will always be of a specific form that can be defined for any monad. Thus in these cases, checking that a monad is a Hopf monad is reduced to checking one identity.

Title: Bifunctor Theorem and strictification tensor product for double categories with lax double functors
Authors: Bojana Femi&cacute;
Abstract: We introduce a candidate for the inner hom for the category of double categories and lax double functors, and characterize a lax double functor into it obtaining a lax double quasi-functor. The latter consists of a pair of lax double functors with four 2-cells resembling distributive laws. We extend this characterization to a double category isomorphism. We show that instead of a Gray monoidal product we obtain a product that in a sense strictifies lax double quasi-functors. We explain why laxity of double functors hinders our candidate for the inner hom from making the category of double categories and lax double functors a closed and enriched category over 2-categories (or double categories). We prove a bifunctor theorem by which certain type of lax double quasi-functors give rise to lax double functors on the Cartesian product. We extend this theorem to a double functor between double categories and show how it restricts to a double equivalence. The (un)currying double functors are studied. We prove that a lax double functor from the trivial double category is a monad in the codomain double category, and show that our above double functor recovers the specification in that double category of the composition natural transformation on the monad functor.

Abstract: We study the categorical-algebraic properties of the semi-abelian variety lGrp of lattice-ordered groups. In particular, we show that this category is fiber-wise algebraically cartesian closed, arithmetical, and strongly protomodular. Moreover, we observe that lGrp is not action accessible, despite the good behaviour of centralizers of internal equivalence relations. Finally, we restrict our attention to the subvariety lAb of lattice-ordered abelian groups, showing that it is algebraically coherent; this provides an example of an algebraically coherent category which is not action accessible.

Title: Surjection-like classes of morphisms
Authors: Pierre-Alain Jacqmin
Abstract: We characterize "good" classes of epimorphisms in a finitely complete category, i.e., those which "interact with finite limits as surjections do in the category Set of sets and functions". More precisely, we prove that given a class E of morphisms in a small finitely complete category C, there exists a faithful conservative (respectively fully faithful) embedding C -> Set^D into a presheaf category which preserves and reflects finite limits and which sends morphisms in E, and only those, to componentwise surjections if and only if E contains the identities, is closed under composition, has the strong right cancellation property, is stable under pullbacks and does not contain any proper monomorphisms (respectively any morphism in it is a regular epimorphism). The classes of split epimorphisms and descent morphisms are such examples and the corresponding full embedding theorems are given by Yoneda and Barr's embeddings. As new examples, we get a conservative embedding theorem for the class of pullback-stable strong epimorphisms and a full embedding theorem for the class of effective descent morphisms. The proof presented here is not based on transfinite inductions and is therefore rather explicit, in contrast with similar embedding theorems.

In order to achieve such result it was also proved that the reflection 2Cat --> 2Preord has stable units, a stronger condition than admissibility in categorical Galois theory, and that the 2-functors surjective both on horizontally and on vertically composable triples of 2-cells are the effective descent morphisms in 2Cat.

Authors: Andrew Slattery
Abstract: We extend the classical work of Kock on strong and commutative monads, as well as the work of Hyland and Power for 2-monads, in order to define strong and pseudocommutative relative pseudomonads. To achieve this, we work in the more general setting of 2-multicategories rather than monoidal 2-categories. We prove analogous implications to the classical work: that a strong relative pseudomonad is a pseudo-multifunctor, and that a pseudocommutative relative pseudomonad is a multicategorical pseudomonad. Furthermore, we extend the work of López Franco with a proof that a lax-idempotent strong relative pseudomonad is pseudocommutative.

Title: Differential Bundles in Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry
Authors: G. S. H. Cruttwell, Jean-Simon Pacaud Lemay
Abstract: In this paper, we explain how the abstract notion of a differential bundle in a tangent category provides a new way of thinking about the category of modules over a commutative ring and its opposite category. MacAdam previously showed that differential bundles in the tangent category of smooth manifolds are precisely smooth vector bundles. Here we provide characterizations of differential bundles in the tangent categories of commutative rings and (affine) schemes. For commutative rings, the category of differential bundles over a commutative ring is equivalent to the category of modules over that ring. For affine schemes, the category of differential bundles over the Spec of a commutative ring is equivalent to the opposite category of modules over said ring. Finally, for schemes, the category of differential bundles over a scheme is equivalent to the opposite category of quasi-coherent sheaves of modules over that scheme.

Title: Monoidal centres and groupoid-graded categories
Authors: Branko Nikoli&#263;, Ross Street
Abstract: We denote the monoidal bicategory of two-sided modules (also called profunctors, bimodules and distributors) between categories by Mod; the tensor product is cartesian product of categories. For a groupoid G, we study the monoidal centre ZPs(G,Mod^op) of the monoidal bicategory Ps(G, Mod^op) of pseudofunctors and pseudonatural transformations; the tensor product is pointwise. Alexei Davydov defined the full centre of a monoid in a monoidal category. We define a higher dimensional version: the full monoidal centre of a monoidale (= pseudomonoid) in a monoidal bicategory M, and it is a braided monoidale in the monoidal centre ZM of M. Each fibration pi : M -> G between groupoids provides an example of a full monoidal centre of a monoidale in Ps(G, Mod^op). For a group G, we explain how the G-graded categorical structures, as considered by Turaev and Virelizier in order to construct topological invariants, fit into this monoidal bicategory context. We see that their structures are monoidales in the monoidal centre of the monoidal bicategory of k-linear categories on which G acts.

Authors: Dominique Bourn
Abstract: The aim of this work is to point out a strong structural phenomenon hidden behind the existence of normalizers through the investigation of this property in the non-pointed context: given any category E, a certain property of the fibration of points \P_E: Pt(E) --> E guarentees the existence of normalizers. This property becomes a characterization of this existence when E is quasi-pointed and protomodular. This property is also showed to be equivalent to a property of the category Grd E of internal groupoids in E which is almost opposite, for the monomorphic internal functors, of the comprehensive factorization.

Title: Cartesian Closed Double Categories
Authors: Susan Niefield
Abstract: We consider two approaches to cartesian closed double categories generalizing two definitions which are equivalent for 1-categories, and give examples to show that the two differ in the double category case. One approach, previously considered in [N20], requires the lax functor (-) x Y on D to have a right adjoint (-)^Y, for every object Y, while the other supposes that the exponentials are given by a lax bifunctor D^op x D --> D also involving vertical (i.e., loose) morphisms of D. Examples include the double categories Cat, Pos, Top, Loc, and Quant, whose objects are small categories, posets, topological spaces, locales, and commutative quantales, respectively; as well as, the double categories Span(D) and Q-Rel, whose vertical morphisms are spans in a category D with pullback and relations valued in a locale Q, respectively.

Title: Geometric morphisms between toposes of monoid actions: factorization systems
Authors: Jens Hemelaer, Morgan Rogers
Abstract: Let M, N be monoids, and PSh(M), Psh(N) their respective categories of right actions on sets. In this paper, we systematically investigate correspondences between properties of geometric morphisms PSh(M) --> PSh(N) and properties of the semigroup homomorphisms M --> N or flat-left-N-right-M-sets inducing them. More specifically, we consider properties of geometric morphisms featuring in factorization systems, namely: surjections, inclusions, localic morphisms, hyperconnected morphisms, terminal-connected morphisms, &eacute;tale morphisms, pure morphisms and complete spreads. We end with an application of topos-theoretic Galois theory to the special case of toposes of the form PSh(M).

Title: Retrocells
Authors: Robert Par&eacute;
Abstract: The notion of retrocell in a double category with companions is introduced and its basic properties established. Explicit descriptions in some of the usual double categories are given. Monads in a double category provide an important example where retrocells arise naturally. Cofunctors appear as a special case. The motivating example of vertically closed double categories is treated in some detail.

Title: Lax comma 2-categories and admissible 2-functors
Authors: Maria Manuel Clementino, Fernando Lucatelli Nunes
Abstract: This paper is a contribution towards a two dimensional extension of the basic ideas and results of Janelidze's Galois theory. In the present paper, we give a suitable counterpart notion to that of <em>absolute admissible Galois structure</em> for the lax idempotent context, compatible with the context of <em>lax orthogonal factorization systems</em>. As part of this work, we study lax comma 2-categories, giving analogue results to the basic properties of the usual comma categories. We show that each morphism of a 2-category induces a 2-adjunction between lax comma 2-categories and comma 2-categories, playing the role of the usual <em>change-of-base functors</em>. With these induced 2-adjunctions, we are able to show that each 2-adjunction induces 2-adjunctions between lax comma 2-categories and comma 2categories, which are our analogues of the usual lifting to the comma categories used in Janelidze's Galois theory. We give sufficient conditions under which these liftings are 2-premonadic and induce a lax idempotent 2-monad, which corresponds to our notion of 2-admissible 2-functor. In order to carry out this work, we analyse when a composition of 2-adjunctions is a lax idempotent 2-monad, and when it is 2-premonadic. We give then examples of our 2-admissible 2-functors (and, in particular, simple 2-functors), especially using a result that says that all admissible (2-)functors in the classical sense are also 2-admissible (and hence simple as well).

Title: On the metrical and quantalic versions of the *-autonomous category of sup-lattices
Authors: Walter Tholen
Abstract: In 1984, Joyal and Tierney presented the category Sup of complete lattices and their suprema-preserving maps as a *-autonomous category in the sense of Barr. Work on this paper was motivated by the question whether the Joyal-Tierney proof may be extended to a metrical context, so that the order of the lattice gets replaced by a generalized metric in the sense of Lawvere. The affirmative answer we give relies crucially on working with not necessarily symmetric metrics. It applies not only to small separated and cocomplete categories enriched in the Boolean quantale 2 (reproducing Sup), or in the Lawvere quantale [0,&#8734;] (producing the category we were looking for), but in any commutative and unital quantale V. Benefitting from previous work by Stubbe, Hofmann, and others, with rather explicit constructions of its tensor product and the internal hom we give an alternative proof that the resulting category V-Sup is *-autonomous, a result first established by Eklund, Guti&eacute;rrez Garc&iacute;a, H&ouml;hle, and Kortelainen in 2018 from a predominantly order-theoretic perspective.

Abstract: In a coherent category, the posets of subobjects have very strong properties. We emphasize the validity of these properties, in general categories, for well-behaved classes of subobjects. As an example of application, we investigate the problem of the various torsion theories which can be universally associated with a pretorsion one.

Title: Distributive idempotents in an order-enriched category
Authors: Christopher Townsend
Abstract: We introduce distributive maps between lattices and consider the categorical assumption that distributive idempotents split. We explore this assumption in the context of a categorical axiomatization of the category of locales. The assumption is shown to be stable under groupoids (this includes slice stability) and we further show that it implies that triquotient surjections are effective descent morphisms. This result follows even without assuming that the underlying (axiomatized) category of locales has coequalizers.

Title: Birkhoff subfibrations of the codomain fibration
Authors: A. S. Cigoli, S. Mantovani
Abstract: Slice categories of a semi-abelian category C have a regular epireflection to their subcategories of internal Mal'tsev algebras. These are Birkhoff reflections, hence admissible with respect to regular epis in the sense of Janelidze's categorical Galois theory. We prove that when C is moreover peri-abelian, these reflections form an admissible Galois structure for a larger class of morphisms, called proquotients. Starting from a careful investigation of the previous situation, we prove that all regular epireflective subfibrations in Fib(C) of the codomain fibration of C can be constructed from a reflective subcategory M_0 of C whose unit morphisms have characteristic kernel. The fibres of such reflective subfibrations are admissible with respect to proquotients precisely when M_0 is a Birkhoff subcategory of C.

Title: A comonad for Grothendieck fibrations
Authors: Jacopo Emmenegger, Luca Mesiti, Giuseppe Rosolini, Thomas Streicher
Abstract: We prove that cloven Grothendieck fibrations over a fixed base B are the pseudo-coalgebras for a lax idempotent 2-comonad on Cat/B. We show this via an original observation that the known colax idempotent 2-monad for fibrations over a fixed base has a right 2-adjoint. As an important consequence, we obtain an original cofree construction of a fibration on a functor. We also give a new, conceptual proof of the fact that the forgetful 2-functor from split fibrations to cloven fibrations over a fixed base has both a left 2-adjoint and a right 2-adjoint, in terms of coherence phenomena of strictification of pseudo-(co)algebras. The 2-monad for fibrations yields the left splitting and the 2-comonad yields the right splitting. Moreover, we show that the constructions induced by these coherence theorems recover Giraud's explicit constructions of the left and the right splittings.

Title: The oplax limit of an enriched category
Authors: Soichiro Fujii, Stephen Lack
Abstract: We show that 2-categories of the form B-Cat are closed under slicing, provided that we allow B to range over bicategories (rather than, say, monoidal categories). That is, for any B-category X, we define a bicategory B/X such that B-cat/X ~= (B/X)-Cat. The bicategory B/X is characterized as the oplax limit of X, regarded as a lax functor from a chaotic category to B, in the 2-category BICAT of bicategories, lax functors and icons. We prove this conceptually, through limit-preservation properties of the 2-functor BICAT -> 2-CAT which maps each bicategory B to the 2-category B-Cat. When B satisfies a mild local completeness condition, we also show that the isomorphism B-Cat/X ~= (B/X)-Cat restricts to a correspondence between fibrations in B-Cat over X on the one hand, and B/X-categories admitting certain powers on the other.

Title: Bi-directional models of `Radically Synthetic' Differential Geometry
Authors: Mat&iacute;as Menni
Abstract: The radically synthetic foundation for smooth geometry formulated in [Law11] postulates a space T with the property that it has a unique point and, out of the monoid T^T of endomorphisms, it extracts a submonoid R which, in many cases, is the (commutative) multiplication of a rig structure. The rig R is said to be <i>bi-directional</i> if its subobject of invertible elements has two connected components. In this case, R may be equipped with a pre-order compatible with the rig structure. We adjust the construction of `well-adapted' models of Synthetic Differential Geometry in order to build the first pre-cohesive toposes with a bi-directional R. We also show that, in one of these pre-cohesive variants, the pre-order on R, <i>derived</i> radically synthetically from bi-directionality, coincides with that <i>defined</i> in the original model.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of Kan injectivity in 2-categories and study its properties. For an adequate 2-category K, we show that every set of morphisms H induces a KZ-pseudomonad on K whose 2-category of pseudoalgebras is the locally full sub-2-category of all objects (left) Kan injective with respect to H and morphisms preserving Kan extensions. The main ingredient is the construction of a (pseudo)chain whose appropriate "convergence" is ensured by a small object argument.

Title: Higher coverings of racks and quandles - Part I
Authors: Fara Renaud
Abstract: This article is the first part of a series of three articles, in which we develop a higher covering theory of racks and quandles. This project is rooted in M. Eisermann's work on quandle coverings, and the categorical perspective brought to the subject by V. Even, who characterizes coverings as those surjections which are central, relatively to trivial quandles. We extend this work by applying the techniques from higher categorical Galois theory, in the sense of G. Janelidze, and in particular we identify meaningful higher-dimensional centrality conditions defining our higher coverings of racks and quandles. <p> In this first article (Part I), we revisit the foundations of the covering theory of interest, we extend it to the more general context of racks and mathematically describe how to navigate between racks and quandles. We explain the algebraic ingredients at play, and reinforce the homotopical and topological interpretations of these ingredients. In particular we study and insist on the crucial role of the left adjoint of the conjugation functor Conj between groups and racks (or quandles). We rename this functor Pth, and explain in which sense it sends a rack to its group of homotopy classes of paths. We characterize coverings and relative centrality using Pth, but also develop a more visual "geometrical" understanding of these conditions. We use alternative generalizable and visual proofs for the characterization of central extensions of racks and quandles. We complete the recovery of M. Eisermann's suitable constructions of weakly universal covers, and fundamental groupoids from a Galois-theoretic perspective. We sketch how to deduce M. Eisermann's detailed classification results from the fundamental theorem of categorical Galois theory. As we develop this complementary understanding of the subject, we lay down all the ideas and results which will articulate the higher-dimensional theory developed in Part II and III.

Title: The 2-localization of a model category
Authors: Dubuc E. J., Girabel J.
Abstract: In this paper we elaborate on a 2-categorical construction of the homotopy category of a Quillen model category. Given any category A and a class of morphisms &Sigma; &sub; A containing the identities, we construct a 2-category Ho(A) obtained by the addition of 2-cells determined by homotopies. A salient feature here is the use of a novel notion of cylinder introduced in [1]. The inclusion 2-functor A &rarr; Ho(A) has a universal property which yields the 2-localization of A at &Sigma; provided that the arrows of &Sigma; become equivalences in Ho(A). This result together with a fibrant-cofibrant replacement is then used to obtain the 2-localization of a model category C at the weak equivalences W. The set of connected components of the hom categories yields a novel proof of Quillen's results. We follow the general lines established in [1], [2] for model bicategories.

Title: A Gelfand duality for continuous lattices
Authors: Ruiyuan Chen
Abstract: We prove that the category of continuous lattices and meet- and directed join-preserving maps is dually equivalent, via the hom functor to [0,1], to the category of complete Archimedean meet-semilattices equipped with a finite meet-preserving action of the monoid of continuous monotone maps of [0,1] fixing 1. We also prove an analogous duality for completely distributive lattices. Moreover, we prove that these are essentially the only well-behaved "sound classes of joins &Phi;, dual to a class of meets" for which "&Phi;-continuous lattice'' and "&Phi;-algebraic lattice" are different notions, thus for which a 2-valued duality does not suffice.

Title: A Model for the Higher Category of Higher Categories
Authors: Nima Rasekh
Abstract: We use fibrations of complete Segal spaces as introduced in [Ras22, Ras23a] to construct four complete Segal spaces: Reedy fibrant simplicial spaces, Segal spaces, complete Segal spaces, and spaces. Moreover, we show each one comes with a universal fibration that classifies Reedy left fibrations, Segal coCartesian fibrations, coCartesian fibrations and left fibrations and prove these are representable fibrations in the sense of [Ras22]. Finally, we use equivalences between quasi-categories and complete Segal spaces constructed in [JT07, Ras21a] to present analogous constructions using fibrations of quasi-categories. <p> As part of establishing the results, we also develop a theory of minimal Reedy fibrations for elegant Reedy categories, which can be of independent interest.

Abstract: In the first part of this note we further the study of the interactions between Reedy and monoidal structures on a small category, building upon the work of Barwick. We define a Reedy monoidal category as a Reedy category R which is monoidal such that for all symmetric monoidal model categories A, the category Fun(R^op, A)_{Reedy} is monoidal model when equipped with the Day convolution. In the second part, we study the category Nec of necklaces, as defined by Baues and Dugger-Spivak. Making use of a combinatorial description present in Grady-Pavlov and Lowen-Mertens, we streamline some proofs from the literature, and finally show that Nec is simple Reedy monoidal.

Hereto we construct and study the anti-Drinfeld double of a Hopf monad. As an application the connection with the pivotality of Drinfeld centres and their underlying categories is discussed.

As an application, we show that if R is Hopf-Galois object over a Hopf algebra A, then their Hochschild cohomological dimension coincide, provided that the cohomological dimension of A is finite and that R has a unital twisted trace with respect to a semi-colinear automorphism.

Title: Directed degeneracy maps for precubical sets
Authors: Philippe Gaucher
Abstract: Symmetric transverse sets were introduced to make the construction of the parallel product with synchronization for process algebras functorial. It is proved that one can do directed homotopy on symmetric transverse sets in the following sense. A q-realization functor from symmetric transverse sets to flows is introduced using a q-cofibrant replacement functor of flows. By topologizing the cotransverse maps, the cotransverse topological cube is constructed. It can be regarded both as a cotransverse topological space and as a cotransverse Lawvere metric space. A natural realization functor from symmetric transverse sets to flows is introduced using Raussen's notion of natural d-path extended to symmetric transverse sets thanks to their structure of Lawvere metric space. It is proved that these two realization functors are homotopy equivalent on cofibrant symmetric transverse sets by using the fact that the small category defining symmetric transverse sets is c-Reedy in Shulman's sense. This generalizes to symmetric transverse sets results previously obtained for precubical sets.

Title: Uniform locales and their constructive aspects
Authors: Graham Manuell
Abstract: Much work has been done on generalising results about uniform spaces to the pointfree context. However, this has almost exclusively been done using classical logic, whereas much of the utility of the pointfree approach lies in its constructive theory, which can be interpreted in many different toposes. Johnstone has advocated for the development of a constructive theory of uniform locales and wrote a short paper on the basic constructive theory via covering uniformities, but he never followed this up with a discussion of entourage uniformities or completions. We present a more extensive constructive development of uniform locales, including both entourage and covering approaches, their equivalence, completions and some applications to metric locales and localic algebra. Some aspects of our presentation might also be of interest even to classically minded pointfree topologists. These include the definition and manipulation of entourage uniformities using the internal logic of the geometric hyperdoctrine of open sublocales and the emphasis on pre-uniform locales. The latter leads to a description of the completion as the uniform reflection of the pre-uniform locale of Cauchy filters and a new result concerning the completion of pre-uniform localic rings, which can be used to easily lift addition and multiplication on Q to R (or Q_p) in the pointfree setting.

Title: A Quillen model structure of local homotopy equivalences
Authors: Guillermo Corti&ntilde;as, Devarshi Mukherjee
Abstract: In this note, we construct a closed model structure on the category of Z/2Z-graded complexes of projective systems of ind-Banach spaces. When the base field is the fraction field F of a complete discrete valuation ring V, the homotopy category of this model category is the derived category of Z/2Z -graded complexes of the quasi-abelian category Ind(Ban_F). This homotopy category is the appropriate target of the local and analytic cyclic homology theories for complete, torsionfree V-algebras and F-algebras. When the base field is C, the homotopy category is the target of local and analytic cyclic homology for pro-bornological C-algebras, which includes the subcategory of pro-C*-algebras.

Title: Formal category theory in augmented virtual double categories
Authors: Seerp Roald Koudenburg
Abstract: In this article we develop formal category theory within augmented virtual double categories. Notably we formalise the classical notions of Kan extension, Yoneda embedding y:A→Â, exact square, total category and 'small' cocompletion; the latter in an appropriate sense. Throughout we compare our formalisations to their corresponding 2-categorical counterparts. Our approach has several advantages. For instance, the structure of augmented virtual double categories naturally allows us to isolate conditions that ensure small cocompleteness of formal presheaf objects Â. Given a monoidal augmented virtual double category K with a Yoneda embedding y:I→Î for its monoidal unit I we prove that, for any unital object A in K that has a 'horizontal dual' A°, the Yoneda embedding y:A→Â exists if and only if the inner hom [A°, Î] exists. This result is a special case of a more general result that, given a functor F:K→L of augmented virtual double categories, allows a Yoneda embedding in L to be "lifted", along a pair of 'universal morphisms' in L, to a Yoneda embedding in K.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to initiate a development of a new non-pointed counterpart of semi-abelian categorical algebra. We are making, however, only the first step in it by giving equivalent definitions of what we call <em>ideally exact categories</em>, and showing that these categories admit a description of quotient objects by means of intrinsically defined ideals, in spite of being non-pointed. As a tool we involve a new notion of <em>essentially nullary monad</em>, and show that Bourn protomodularity condition makes cartesian monads essentially nullary. All semi-abelian categories, all non-trivial Bourn protomodular varieties of universal algebras, and all cotoposes are ideally exact.

Title: On reachability categories, persistence, and commuting algebras of quivers
Authors: Luigi Caputi, Henri Riihim&auml;ki
Abstract: For a finite quiver Q, we study the <em>reachability category</em> Reach_Q. We investigate the properties of Reach_Q from both a categorical and a topological viewpoint. In particular, we compare Reach_Q with Path_Q, the category freely generated by Q. As a first application, we study the category algebra of Reach_Q, which is isomorphic to the <em>commuting algebra</em> of Q. As a consequence, we recover, in a categorical framework, previous results obtained by Green and Schroll; we show that the commuting algebra of Q is Morita equivalent to the incidence algebra of a poset, the reachability poset. We further show that commuting algebras are Morita equivalent if and only if the reachability posets are isomorphic. As a second application, we define <em>persistent Hochschild homology of quivers</em> via reachability categories.

Abstract: For a compact group G, the functor from unital Banach algebras with contractive morphisms to metric spaces with 1-Lipschitz maps sending a Banach algebra A to the space of G-representations in A preserves filtered colimits.

We also give an alternative proof of that finite presentability result, along with parallel results on functors represented by compact metric, metric convex, or metric absolutely convex spaces.

Title: Left adjoint to precomposition in elementary doctrines
Authors: Francesca Guffanti
Abstract: It is well-known in universal algebra that adding structure and equational axioms generates forgetful functors between varieties, and such functors all have left adjoints. The category of elementary doctrines provides a natural framework for studying algebraic theories, since each algebraic theory can be described by some syntactic doctrine and its models are homomorphisms from the syntactic doctrine into the doctrine of subsets. In this context, adding structure and axioms to a theory can be described by a homomorphism between the two corresponding syntactic doctrines, and the forgetful functor arises as precomposition with this last homomorphism. In this work, given any homomorphism of elementary doctrines, we prove the existence of a left adjoint of the functor induced by precomposition in the doctrine of subobjects of a Grothendieck topos.

Title: Lax comma categories: cartesian closedness, extensivity, topologicity, and descent
Authors: Maria Manuel Clementino, Fernando Lucatelli Nunes, Rui Prezado
Abstract: We investigate the properties of lax comma categories over a base category X, focusing on topologicity, extensivity, cartesian closedness, and descent. We establish that the forgetful functor from Cat//X to Cat is topological if and only if X is large-complete. Moreover, we provide conditions for Cat//X to be complete, cocomplete, extensive and cartesian closed. We analyze descent in Cat//X and identify necessary conditions for effective descent morphisms. Our findings contribute to the literature on lax comma categories and provide a foundation for further research in 2-dimensional Janelidze's Galois theory.

Title: Factorization systems and double categories

Abstract: We show that factorization systems, both strict and orthogonal, can be equivalently described as double categories satisfying certain properties. This provides conceptual reasons for why the category of sets and partial maps or the category of small categories and cofunctors admit orthogonal factorization systems. The theory also gives an explicit description of various lax morphism classifiers and explains why they admit strict factorization systems.

Abstract: In this article, we introduce the first degrees of a cochain complex associated to a strict Lie 2-group whose cohomology is shown to extend the classical cohomology theory of Lie groups. In particular, we show that the second cohomology group classifies an appropriate type of extensions. We conclude putting forward evidence that this complex can be extended to arbitrary degrees.

Title: Adjoint functor theorems for lax-idempotent pseudomonads
Authors: Nathanael Arkor, Ivan Di Liberti, Fosco Loregian
Abstract: For each pair of lax-idempotent pseudomonads R and I, for which I is locally fully faithful and R distributes over I, we establish an adjoint functor theorem, relating R-cocontinuity to adjointness relative to I. This provides a new perspective on the nature of adjoint functor theorems, which may be seen as methods to decompose adjointness into cocontinuity and relative adjointness. As special cases, we recover variants of the adjoint functor theorem of Freyd, the multiadjoint functor theorem of Diers, and the pluriadjoint functor theorem of Solian-Viswanathan, as well as the adjoint functor theorems for locally presentable categories. More generally, we recover enriched &Phi;-adjoint functor theorems for weakly sound classes of weight &Phi;.

Our goal is to abstract the categorical structure required to obtain an equivalence between functor categories [F,V] and [G,V] where G is the core groupoid of the category F and V is a category of modules over a commutative ring.

Title: Bicategorical traces and cotraces
Authors: Justin Barhite
Abstract: The familiar trace of a square matrix generalizes to a trace of an endomorphism of a dualizable object in a symmetric monoidal category. To extend these ideas to other settings, such as modules over non-commutative rings, the trace can be generalized to a bicategory equipped with additional structure called a shadow. We propose a notion of bicategorical cotrace of certain maps involving dualizable objects in a closed bicategory equipped with a coshadow, and we use this framework to draw connections to work of Lipman on residues and traces with Hochschild (co)homology, and to work of Ganter and Kapranov on 2-representations and 2-characters.

Title: Free precategories as presheaf categories
Authors: Simon Forest, Samuel Mimram
Abstract: Precategories generalize both the notions of strict n-category and sesquicategory: their definition is essentially the same as the one of strict n-categories, excepting that the various interchange laws are not required to hold. Those have been proposed as a framework in which one can express semi-strict definitions of weak higher categories. In particular, in dimension 3, Gray categories are particular 3-precategories which have been shown to be equivalent to tricategories. In this article, we are mostly interested in free precategories. Those can be presented by generators and relations, using an appropriate variation on the notion of polygraph (aka computad), and earlier works have shown that the theory of rewriting can be generalized to this setting, enjoying most of the fundamental constructions and properties which can be found in the traditional theory: with respect to this, polygraphs for precategories are much better behaved than their counterpart for strict categories. We further study here why this is the case, by providing several results which show that precategories and their associated polygraphs bear properties which ensure that we have a good syntax for those. In particular, we show that the category of polygraphs for precategories form a presheaf category.

Title: From Specker &#8467;-groups to boolean algebras via &Gamma;
Authors: Daniele Mundici
Abstract: The author constructed in 1986 an equivalence &Gamma; between abelian &#8467;-groups with a strong unit and C.C. Chang MV-algebras. In 1958 Chang proved that boolean algebras coincide with MV-algebras satisfying the equation x &oplus; x = x. In this paper it is proved that &Gamma; yields, by restriction, an equivalence between the category S of Specker &#8467;-groups whose distinguished unit is singular, and the category of boolean algebras. As a consequence, Grothendieck's K_0 functor yields an equivalence between abelian Bratteli AF-algebras and the countable fragment of S. An equivalence in the opposite direction is obtained by a combination of &Gamma; with the Stone and Gelfand dualities.

Title: Lifting twisted coreflections against delta lenses
Authors: Bryce Clarke
Abstract: Delta lenses are functors equipped with a suitable choice of lifts, generalising the notion of split opfibration. In recent work, delta lenses were characterised as the right class of an algebraic weak factorisation system. In this paper, we show that this algebraic weak factorisation system is cofibrantly generated by a small double category, and characterise the left class as split coreflections with a certain property; we call these twisted coreflections. We demonstrate that every twisted coreflection arises as a pushout of an initial functor from a discrete category along a bijective-on-objects functor. Throughout the article, we take advantage of a reformulation of algebraic weak factorisation systems, due to Bourke, based on double-categorical lifting operations.

Title: Indexed Grothendieck construction
Authors: Elena Caviglia, Luca Mesiti
Abstract: We produce an indexed version of the Grothendieck construction. This gives an equivalence of categories between opfibrations over a fixed base in the 2-category of 2-copresheaves and 2-copresheaves on the Grothendieck construction of the fixed base. We also prove that this equivalence is pseudonatural in the base and that it restricts to discrete opfibrations with small fibres and copresheaves. Our result is a 2-dimensional generalization of the equivalence between slices of copresheaves and copresheaves on slices. We can think of the indexed Grothendieck construction as a simultaneous Grothendieck construction on every index that takes into account all bonds between different indexes.

Title: On domain-like objects in the category of unitary rings
Authors: W. D. Burgess, R. Raphael
Abstract: In the category C of unitary rings, Barr, Kennison and Raphael (2015) studied the limit closures of various classes of commutative integral domains; in particular the class of all domains and of integrally closed domains to form the reflective subcategories K_dom and K_ic. This article looks at K_dom(R) and K_ic(R) - the same symbols are used for the subcategories and the reflection functors - for some rings R. The objects in K_dom can be called "domain-like". Of particular interest is the ring C^1(R), the ring of real functions with continuous first derivative. The ring L is that of continuous functions that are C^1 on a dense open set of R. Then K_dom(C^1(R)) &sub; K_ic(C^1(R)) &sub; L, with proper inclusions. Moreover, for f in K_dom(C^1(R)), f has one-sided derivatives and those are one-sided continuous. <p> For commutative rings R &sub; S in R there is a subring of the integral closure of R in S introduced here, called the <i>split integral closure</i>, that is explored and turns out to be very useful.

Title: Pointwise Kan extensions along 2-fibrations and the 2-category of elements
Authors: Luca Mesiti
Abstract: We study the 2-category of elements from an abstract point of view. We generalize to dimension 2 the well-known result that the category of elements can be captured by a comma object that also exhibits a pointwise left Kan extension. For this, we propose an original definition of pointwise Kan extension along a discrete 2-opfibration in the lax 3-category of 2-categories, 2-functors, lax natural transformations and modifications. Such definition uses cartesian-marked lax limits, which are an alternative to weighted 2-limits. We show that a pointwise Kan extension along a discrete 2-opfibration is always a weak one as well. The proof is based on an original generalization of the parametrized Yoneda lemma which is as lax as it can be.

Authors: Guillermo L&oacute;pez Cafaggi
Abstract: There is a lattice of torsion theories in simplicial groups such that the torsion/torsion-free categories are given by simplicial groups with truncated Moore complex below/above a certain degree. We study the restriction of these torsion theories to certain subcategories of simplicial groups. In particular, we prove that the categories of D. Conduch&eacute;'s 2-crossed modules and Ashley's crossed complexes in groups are semi-abelian and we give some descriptions of their torsion theories. These examples of torsion theories also give rise to new examples of pretorsion theories in the sense of A. Facchini and C. Finocchiaro, as well as examples of torsion torsion-free theories (TTF theories).

Title: The category of extensions and idempotent completion
Authors: R. Bennett-Tennenhaus, J. Haugland, M. H. Sand&oslash;y, A. Shah
Abstract: Building on previous work, we study the splitting of idempotents in the category of extensions E-Ext(C) associated to a pair (C,E) of an additive category and a biadditive functor to the category of abelian groups. In particular, we show that idempotents split in E-Ext(C) whenever they do so in C, allowing us to prove that idempotent completions and extension categories are compatible constructions in a 2-category-theoretic sense. Furthermore, we show that the exact category obtained by first taking the idempotent completion of an n-exangulated category (C,E,s), in the sense of Klapproth-Msapato-Shah, and then considering its category of extensions is equivalent to the exact category obtained by first passing to the extension category and then taking the idempotent completion. These two different approaches yield a pair of 2-functors each taking small n-exangulated categories to small idempotent complete exact categories. The collection of equivalences that we provide constitutes a 2-natural transformation between these 2-functors. Similar results with no smallness assumptions and regarding weak idempotent completions are also proved.

Abstract: We investigate the properties of the Kleisli category Kl T of a monad T on a category E and in particular the existence of (some kind of) pullbacks. This culminates when the monad is cartesian. In this case, we show that any T-category in E in the sense of A. Burroni coincides with a special kind of internal category in Kl T. Thus, it is the case in particular for T-operads and T-multicategories. More unexpectedly, this, in turn, sheds new conceptual lights on internal categories and n-categories.

Title: Condensation inversion and Witt equivalence via generalised orbifolds
Authors: Vincentas Mulevi&#269;ius
Abstract: In Mulevi&#269;ius-Runkel, Quant. Topol. 13:3 (2022), it was shown how a so-called orbifold datum A in a given modular fusion category (MFC) C produces a new MFC C(A). Examples of these associated MFCs include condensations, i.e. the categories of local modules of a separable commutative algebra B in C. In this paper we prove that the relation C~C(A) on MFCs is the same as Witt equivalence. This is achieved in part by providing one with an explicit construction for inverting condensations, i.e. finding an orbifold datum A in the category of local modules of B, whose associated MFC is equivalent to C. As a tool used in this construction we also explore what kinds of functors F:C->D between MFCs preserve orbifold data. It turns out that F need not necessarily be strong monoidal, but rather a `ribbon Frobenius' functor, which has weak monoidal and weak comonoidal structures, related by a Frobenius-like property.

Title: Categorical generalisations of quantum double models
Authors: Anna-Katharina Hirmer, Catherine Meusburger
Abstract: We show that every involutive Hopf monoid in a complete and finitely cocomplete symmetric monoidal category gives rise to invariants of oriented surfaces defined in terms of ribbon graphs. For every ribbon graph this yields an object in the category, defined up to isomorphism, that depends only on the homeomorphism class of the associated surface. This object is constructed via (co)equalisers and images and equipped with a mapping class group action. It can be viewed as a categorical generalisation of the ground state of Kitaev's quantum double model or of a representation variety for a surface. We apply the construction to group objects in cartesian monoidal categories, in particular to simplicial groups as group objects in SSet and to crossed modules as group objects in Cat. The former yields a simplicial set consisting of representation varieties, the latter a groupoid whose sets of objects and morphisms are obtained from representation varieties.

Title: Filtral pretoposes and compact Hausdorff locales
Authors: C&eacute;lia Borlido, Panagis Karazeris, Luca Reggio, Konstantinos Tsamis
Abstract: The category of compact Hausdorff locales is a pretopos which is filtral, meaning that every object is covered by one whose subobject lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of filters of complemented elements. We show that any filtral pretopos satisfying some mild additional conditions can be embedded into the category of compact Hausdorff locales. This result is valid in the internal logic of any topos. Assuming the principle of weak excluded middle and the existence of copowers of the terminal object in the pretopos, the image of the embedding contains all spatial compact Hausdorff locales. <p> The notion of filtrality was introduced by V. Marra and L. Reggio (Theory Appl. Categ., 2020) to characterise the category of compact Hausdorff spaces within the class of pretoposes. Our results can be regarded as a constructive extension of the aforementioned characterisation, avoiding reference to points. If the ambient logic is classical, i.e. it satisfies excluded middle, and the prime ideal theorem for Boolean algebras holds, we obtain as a corollary the characterisation of compact Hausdorff spaces in <i>op. cit</i>.

Title: A 2-categorical analysis of context comprehension
Authors: Greta Coraglia, Jacopo Emmenegger
Abstract: We consider the equivalence between the two main categorical models for the type-theoretical operation of context comprehension, namely P. Dybjer's categories with families and B. Jacobs' comprehension categories, and generalise it to the non-discrete case. The classical equivalence can be summarised in the slogan: "terms as sections". By recognising "terms as coalgebras", we show how to use the structure-semantics adjunction to prove that a 2-category of comprehension categories is biequivalent to a 2-category of (non-discrete) categories with families. The biequivalence restricts to the classical one proved by Hofmann in the discrete case. It also provides a framework where to compare different morphisms of these structures that have appeared in the literature, varying on the degree of preservation of the relevant structure. We consider in particular morphisms defined by Claraimbault-Dybjer, Jacobs, Larrea, and Uemura.

Title: From Ramsey degrees to Ramsey expansions via weak amalgamation
Authors: Dragan Ma&#353;ulovi&cacute;, Andy Zucker
Abstract: In this paper we provide another argument to support the recently reinvigorated interest in treating Ramsey-type phenomena categorically. Using purely categorical strategies we construct a Ramsey expansion for every category of finite objects with finite small Ramsey degrees. Our construction is based on the relationship between small Ramsey degrees, weak amalgamation, and recent results about weak Fra&iuml;ss&eacute; categories. Starting from the fact that weak Fra&iuml;ss&eacute; categories allow for certain model-theoretic properties to be reflected in the free &omega;-cocompletion of the category, we show that classes with finite Ramsey degrees have weak amalgamation and then invoke the machinery of weak Fra&iuml;ss&eacute; categories to perform the construction. This improves previous similar results where an analogous construction was carried out under the assumption that everything sits comfortably in a bigger class with enough infrastructure, and that in this wider context there is an ultrahomogeneous structure under whose umbrella the construction takes place.

Authors: Alexandru Chirvasitu
Abstract: We prove a number of results of the following common flavor: for a category C of topological or uniform spaces with all manner of other properties of common interest (separation / completeness / compactness axioms), a group (or monoid) G equipped with various types of topological structure (topologies, uniformities) and the corresponding category C^G of appropriately compatible G-flows in C, the forgetful functor C^G &rarr; C is monadic. In all cases of interest the domain category C^G is also cocomplete, so that results on adjunction lifts along monadic functors apply to provide equivariant completion and/or compactification functors. This recovers, unifies and generalizes a number of such results in the literature due to de Vries, Mart'yanov and others on existence of equivariant compactifications / completions and cocompleteness of flow categories.

Title: Comparing 2-crossed modules with Gray 3-groups
Authors: Murat Sarikaya, Erdal Ulualan
Abstract: In this paper, we have constructed the close relationship between 2-crossed modules and Gray 3-groupoids with a single object (Gray 3-groups). Using both the equivalence between 2-crossed modules and Gray 3-groups, and the Gray category structure over the category of chain complexes of vector spaces; we describe linear representations as certain 3-functors.

Title: Graded braided commutativity in Hochschild cohomology
Authors: Javier C&oacute;ppola, Andrea Solotar
Abstract: We prove the graded braided commutativity of the Hochschild cohomology of A with trivial coefficients, where A is a braided Hopf algebra in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over the group algebra of an abelian group, under some finiteness conditions on a projective resolution of A as A-bimodule. This is a generalization of a result by Mastnak, Pevtsova, Schauenburg and Witherspoon to a context which includes Nichols algebras such as the Jordan and the super Jordan plane. We prove this result by constructing a coduoid-up-to-homotopy structure on the aforementioned projective resolution in the duoidal category of chain complexes of A-bimodules. We also prove that the Hochschild complex of a braided bialgebra A in an arbitrary braided monoidal category is a cocommutative comonoid up to homotopy with the deconcatenation product which induces the cup product in Hochschild cohomology.

Title: A coherence theorem for pseudo symmetric multifunctors
Authors: Diego Manco
Abstract: Donald Yau defined the notion of pseudo symmetric Cat-enriched multifunctor between Cat-enriched multicategories and proved that Mandell's inverse K-theory multifunctor is pseudo symmetric. We prove a coherence theorem for pseudo symmetric Cat-enriched multifunctors. As an application we prove that pseudo symmetric Cat-enriched multifunctors, and in particular Mandell's inverse K-theory, preserve &Sigma;-free E_n-algebras (n=1,2,...,&infin;), at the cost of changing the parameterizing &Sigma;-free E_n-operad O for the &Sigma;-free E_n-operad O x E&Sigma;_*.

Title: Yoneda lemma and representation theorem for double categories
Authors: Benedikt Fr&ouml;hlich, Lyne Moser
Abstract: We study (vertically) normal lax double functors valued in the weak double category Cat of small categories, functors, profunctors and natural transformations, which we refer to as lax double presheaves. We show that for the theory of double categories they play a similar role as 2-functors valued in Cat for 2-categories. We first introduce representable lax double presheaves and establish a Yoneda lemma. Then we build a Grothendieck construction which gives a 2-equivalence between lax double presheaves and discrete double fibrations over a fixed double category. Finally, we prove a representation theorem showing that a lax double presheaf is represented by an object if and only if its Grothendieck construction has a double terminal object.

Title: What is the universal property of the 2-category of monads?
Authors: Stephen Lack, Adrian Miranda
Abstract: For a 2-category K, we consider Street's 2-category Mnd(K) of monads in K, along with Lack and Street's 2-category EM(K) and the identity-on-objects-and-1-cells 2-functor Mnd(K) &rarr; EM(K) between them. We show that this 2-functor can be obtained as a "free completion" of the 2-functor 1: K &rarr; K. We do this by regarding 2-functors which act as the identity on both objects and 1-cells as categories enriched a cartesian closed category BO whose objects are identity-on-objects functors. We also develop some of the theory of BO-enriched categories.

Title: Inner automorphisms as 2-cells
Authors: Pieter Hofstra, Martti Karvonen
Abstract: Abstract inner automorphisms can be used to promote any category into a 2-category, and we study two-dimensional limits and colimits in the resulting 2-categories. Existing connected colimits and limits in the starting category become two-dimensional colimits and limits under fairly general conditions. Under the same conditions, colimits in the underlying category can be used to build many notable two-dimensional colimits such as coequifiers and coinserters. In contrast, disconnected colimits or genuinely 2-categorical limits such as inserters and equifiers and cotensors cannot exist unless no nontrivial abstract inner automorphisms exist and the resulting 2-category is locally discrete. We also study briefly when an ordinary functor can be extended to a 2-functor between the resulting 2-categories.

Title: Topological endomorphism monoids of models of geometric theories
Authors: Morgan Rogers
Abstract: A classical model theory result states that for a (set-theoretic) model of a first-order theory, there is a Galois connection between subgroups of the automorphism group of the model and `relational extensions' of the model, and the subgroups which are fixed by this connection are precisely the closed subgroups for the `pointwise convergence topology' on the automorphism group. We prove an analogous result for endomorphism monoids of models, grounded in the theory of classifying toposes. In particular, we show that the topos of continuous actions of the endomorphism monoid with respect to the pointwise convergence topology classifies a natural theory associated to the model.

Title: Quotients, pure existential completions and arithmetic universes
Authors: Maria Emilia Maietti, Davide Trotta
Abstract: We provide a new description of Joyal's arithmetic universes through a characterization of the exact and regular completions of pure existential completions. <p> We show that the regular and exact completions of the pure existential completion of an elementary doctrine Pare equivalent to the reg/lex and ex/lex-completions, respectively, of the category of predicates of P. <p> This result generalizes a previous one by the first author with F. Pasquali and G. Rosolini about doctrines equipped with Hilbert's 	&epsilon;-operators. <p> Thanks to this characterization, each arithmetic universe in the sense of Joyal can be seen as the exact completion of the pure existential completion of the doctrine of predicates of its Skolem theory. <p> In particular, the initial arithmetic universe in the standard category of ZFC-sets turns out to be the completion with exact quotients of the doctrine of recursively enumerable predicates.

Title: Inner automorphisms of groupoids
Authors: Richard Garner
Abstract: Bergman has given the following abstract characterisation of the inner automorphisms of a group G: they are exactly those automorphisms of G which can be extended functorially along any homomorphism G &rarr; H to an automorphism of H. This leads naturally to a definition of "inner automorphism" applicable to the objects of any category. Bergman and Hofstra-Parker-Scott have computed these inner automorphisms for various structures including k-algebras, monoids, lattices, unital rings, and quandles-showing that, in each case, they are given by an obvious notion of conjugation. <p> In this paper, we compute the inner automorphisms of groupoids, showing that they are exactly the automorphisms induced by conjugation by a bisection. The twist is that this result is <i>false</i> in the category of groupoids and functors; to make it true, we must instead work with the less familiar category of groupoids and <i>cofunctors</i> in the sense of Higgins and Mackenzie. Besides our main result, we also discuss generalisations to topological and Lie groupoids, to categories and to partial automorphisms, and examine the link with the theory of inverse semigroups.

Title: Classical Distributive Restriction Categories
Authors: Robin Cockett, Jean-Simon Pacaud Lemay
Abstract: In the category of sets and partial functions, PAR, while the disjoint union &sqcup; is the usual categorical coproduct, the Cartesian product &times; becomes a restriction categorical analogue of the categorical product: a restriction product. Nevertheless, PAR does have a usual categorical product as well in the form A & B := A &sqcup; B &sqcup; (A &times; B). Surprisingly, asking that a <i>distributive</i> restriction category (a restriction category with restriction products &times; and coproducts &oplus;) has A & B a categorical product is enough to imply that the category is a <i>classical</i> restriction category. This is a restriction category which has joins and relative complements and, thus, supports classical Boolean reasoning. The first and main observation of the paper is that a distributive restriction category is classical if and only if A & B := A &oplus; B &oplus; (A &times; B) is a categorical product in which case we call & the "classical" product. <p> In fact, a distributive restriction category has a categorical product if and only if it is a <i>classified</i> restriction category. This is in the sense that every map A &rarr; B factors uniquely through a total map A &rarr; B &oplus; 1, where 1 is the restriction terminal object. This implies the second significant observation of the paper, namely, that a distributive restriction category has a classical product if and only if it is the Kleisli category of the exception monad _ &oplus; 1 for an ordinary distributive category. <p> Thus having a classical product has a significant structural effect on a distributive restriction category. In particular, the classical product not only provides an alternative axiomatization for being classical but also for being the Kleisli category of the exception monad on an ordinary distributive category.

Title: Factorization Systems for Restriction Categories
Authors: Robin Cockett, G. S. H. Cruttwell, Jonathan Gallagher, Dorette Pronk
Abstract: This paper describes the notion of a (latent) factorization system for a restriction category. Analogous to factorization systems for ordinary categories, a description in terms of a Galois connection based on an orthogonality relation is given. The orthogonality relation involving a unique cross-map (or lifting), however, is between a pair, consisting of a map together with a restriction idempotent, and a map. This gives a significantly different character to the theory. <p> A restriction category in which the idempotents split is precisely a partial map category whose partiality is given by the system of monics which split the restriction idempotents. A restriction factorization on such a partial map category is completely characterized by a factorization on the total maps which is stable with respect to the system of monics; that is, pullbacks of both E and M-maps along these special monics are (respectively) E and M-maps. <p> Examples of latent factorization systems are discussed. In particular, one source of latent factorizations is provided by lifting latent factorizations from the base of a latent fibration into the total category: this is a generalization of the observation that one can lift a factorization from the base of an ordinary fibration into the total category.

Title: The eventual image
Authors: Tom Leinster
Abstract: In a category with enough limits and colimits, one can form the universal automorphism on an endomorphism in two dual senses. Sometimes these dual constructions coincide, including in the categories of finite sets, finite-dimensional vector spaces, and compact metric spaces. There, beginning with an endomorphism f, there is a doubly-universal automorphism on f whose underlying object is the eventual image &cap;_{n >= 0} im(f^n). Our main theorem unifies these examples, stating that in any category with a factorization system satisfying certain axioms, the eventual image has two dual universal properties. A further theorem characterizes the eventual image as a terminal coalgebra. In all, nine characterizations of the eventual image are given, valid at different levels of generality.

Title: Weak vertical composition
Authors: Eugenia Cheng, Alexander S. Corner
Abstract: We study semi-strict tricategories in which the only weakness is in vertical composition. We construct these as categories enriched in the category of bicategories with strict functors, with respect to the cartesian monoidal structure. As these are a form of tricategory it follows that doubly-degenerate ones are braided monoidal categories. We show that this form of semi-strict tricategory is weak enough to produce all braided monoidal categories. That is, given any braided monoidal category B there is a doubly-degenerate "vertically weak" semi-strict tricategory whose associated braided monoidal category is braided monoidal equivalent to B.

Title: Internal parameterization of hyperconnected quotients
Authors: Ryuya Hora
Abstract: One of the most fundamental facts in topos theory is the internal parameterization of subtoposes: the bijective correspondence between subtoposes and Lawvere-Tierney topologies. In this paper, we introduce a new but elementary concept, "a local state classifier", and give an analogous internal parameterization of hyperconnected quotients (i.e., hyperconnected geometric morphisms from a topos). As a corollary, we obtain a solution to the Boolean case of the first problem of Lawvere's open problems.

Title: A syntactic characterization of weakly Mal'tsev varieties
Authors: Nadja Egner, Pierre-Alain Jacqmin, Nelson Martins-Ferreira
Abstract: The notion of a weakly Mal'tsev category, as it was introduced in 2008 by the third author, is a generalization of the classical notion of a Mal'tsev category. It is well-known that a variety of universal algebras is a Mal'tsev category if and only if its theory admits a Mal'tsev term. In the main theorem of this paper, we prove a syntactic characterization of the varieties that are weakly Mal'tsev categories. We apply our result to the variety of distributive lattices which was known to be a weakly Mal'tsev category before. By a result of Z. Janelidze and the third author, a finitely complete category is weakly Mal'tsev if and only if any internal strong reflexive relation is an equivalence relation. In the last part of this paper, we give a syntactic characterization of those varieties in which any regular reflexive relation is an equivalence relation.
