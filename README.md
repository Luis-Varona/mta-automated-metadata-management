# mta-tac-metadata-collection

Collecting and managing metadata for MtA's *Theory and Applications of Categories* journal. **STATUS:**

1. Figure out proper version/revision numbering (currently set to 1 by default)
2. Fix mapping from &lt;br&gt; and &lt;p&gt; (in the abstracts) to escape sequences
3. Add a new tag for MSC classification (currently placed in &lt;abstract&gt;)
4. Verify separation of &lt;givenname&gt; and &lt;familyname&gt; for relevant articles (this is extremely hard to automate and likely needs human intuition)
5. After all this is done, import everything to the OJS system and we are finished!
